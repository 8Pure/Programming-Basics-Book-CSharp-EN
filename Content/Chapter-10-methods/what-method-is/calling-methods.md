### Calling Methods

Calling a method means **starting to execute the code**, which is in **the body of the method**. This happens by writing its **name**, followed by parentheses **`()`** and the sign **`;`** to end the row. If the method needs input data, it is given in the parentheses **`()`**, and the succession of the parameters should be the same as the one of the given parameters when declaring the method. Here is an Example:![](/assets/chapter-10-images/03.Invoking-methods-01.png)

A method can be invoked from **several places** in the program. One way is to call it in **the main method**.

A method can also be called from **the body of another method**, which is **not** the main method of the program.

There is also a possibility for the method to be invoked in **its own body**. This is called **recursion** and you can find more information about it in [Wikipedia](https://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A0%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%80%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%8F) or you can search on your own in the Internet.

It is important to know that if a method is declared in a class, it can be invoked before the line, on which it has been declared.
