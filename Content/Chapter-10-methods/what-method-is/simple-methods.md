### Simple Methods

**The simple** methods are tasked to do a certain **task**, which **helps** to solve a given problem. These actions can be printing a string on the console, doing a verification, executing a loop and others.

Let's see the following **example for a simple code**:

This method must print a header, which is a sequence of hte **`-`** symbol. Because of this its name is **`PrintHeader`**. The parentheses **`( `** and **`)` always** follow the name, no matter what we called the method. We will later see how to name the methods we work with and for the moment we will only say that it is important for **its name to describe the task** the method is doing.

**The body** of the method contains **the program code**, which is between the curly brackets **`{`** and **`}`**. These brackets **always** follow its **declaration** and between them we write the code, which solves the problem described by the methods name.
