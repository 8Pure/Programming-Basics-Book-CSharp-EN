## What Is a "Method"?

Up until now we found out that when **writing** the code of a program, which solves a problem, what makes it **easier** is that we **divide** the task into **parts**. Each part fulfills **a given action** and this way it is not only **easier** to solve the task, but the **readability** of the code and looking for mistakes is significantly better.

Each piece of code, which executes some functionality and has been separated logically can take the functionality of the method. This is exactly what **methods are â€“ pieces of code with names** given by us in a certain way and which can be **invoked** as many times as we need them.

A method can be invoked as many times, as we think we need to solve a problem. This **saves** us repeating the same code over and over, and also **reduces** the possibility to miss a mistake when correcting the code.
