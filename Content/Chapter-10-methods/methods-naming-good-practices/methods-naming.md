### Naming Methods

When you name a method it is good to use **meaningful names**. Because every method **answers** for a part of our problem, when naming it we should keep in mind **the action it does**, i.e. it is a good practice for **the name to describe what the method does**.

The name must start with **uppercase** and should be made of a verb or a couple: verb + noun. The name is formatted by following the **Upper Case Camel** convention, i.e. **each word, including the first, starts with uppercase**. The brackets **`( `** and **`)`** always follow the name. 

Each method must do one task and its name should describe what its function is. 

A few examples for **correctly** naming our methods:
* **`FindStudent`**
*	**`LoadReport`**
*	**`Sine`**

A few examples for **incorrectly** naming our methods:
*	**`Method1`**
*	**`DoSomething`**
*	**`HandleStuff`**
*	**`SampleMethod`**
*	**`DirtyHack`**

If you can not think of a good name then the method most probably solves more than one task or doesn't have a clearly defined purpose and in this case you have to think how to divide it in several simpler methods.
