### Good Practices When Working With Methods

Let us remind you that a method should do **only one** defined **task**. If this can not be done you must think how to **divide** the method into a few, smaller ones. As we already said the name of the method should be clear and should describe its purpose. Another good practice in programming is to **avoid** methods, which are longer than our screen (approximately). If the code still becomes large it is recommended to **divide** it into several, shorter methods, as in the example below.
