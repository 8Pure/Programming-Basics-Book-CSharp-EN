### Code Structure and Formatting

When writing methods we should be careful to do correct **indentation** (moving blocks of the code to the right).

Example for **correctly** formatted C# code:

Example for **incorrectly** formatted C# code:

![](/assets/chapter-10-images/20.Good-practice-03.png)

When the title line of the method is **too long**, it is recommended to divide it into several lines, as each line after the first is two tabulations to the right of the first (for better readability):

Another good practice when writing code is **to leave an empty row** between the methods, after loops and conditional statements. Also try to **abstain** from writing **long lines and complicated expressions**. In time you will see that this makes the readability better and saves time. 

It is also recommended to always **use cirly brackets for the bodies of conditional statements and loops**. The brackets not only improve readability, but also reduce the possibility to make a mistake and the program to run incorrectly.
