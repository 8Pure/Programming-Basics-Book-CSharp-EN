### Return Value Types

Up until now wesaw some examples, in which when declaring methods we used the keyword **`void`**, which shows that the method **does not** return a result, but just executes a certain action.

If we **replace** **`void`** with **a type** of some variable, this will tell the program that the method should return a value of the said type. This returned value could be of any type â€“ **`int`**, **`string`**, **`double`** etc.

We should note that **the result** returned by the method can be of **a type, compatible with the type of the return value** of the method. For example if the declared type of the return value is **`double`**, we can return a value of type **`int`**.
