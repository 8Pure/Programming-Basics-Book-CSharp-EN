### Example: Math Power

Create a method which calculates and returns as result the power of a given number.

#### Sample Input and Output

| Input | Output | Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|2<br>8|256|3<br>4|81|

#### Hints and Guidelines

Our first step is to read the input data from the console. The next step is to create a method, which will take two parameters (the number and the power) and returns as a result a number of type **`double`**.

After we have done the calculations, we have to only print the result in the **`Main()`** method of the program.
