### Methods Returning Multiple Values

There are cases in practice when we need a method to return more than one element as a result. For this to be possible **`ValueTuple`** has been integrated in Visual Studio and C# (onwards from C# 7), and also a literal of type **`ValueTuple`**. The type **`ValueTuple`** represents two values, which allow the temporary containing of **multiple values**. The values are contained in variables (fields - we will earn about them later) of the corresponding types. Although the type **`Tuple`** existed before C# 7, it didn't have good support in the older versions and it's ineffective. That's why in previous versions of C# the elements in one **`Tuple`** were shown as **`Item1`**, **`Item2`** etc. and the names of their variables (the variables in which they are contained) could not be changed. In C# 7 the type (**`ValueTuple`**) is maintained, which allows giving meaningful names to the elements in a **`ValueTuple`**.
