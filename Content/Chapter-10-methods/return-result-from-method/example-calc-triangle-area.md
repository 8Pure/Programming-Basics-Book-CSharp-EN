### Example: Calculating Triangle Area

Create a method that calculates the area of a triangle using the given base and heigth and returns it as a result.

#### Sample Input and Output

| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |
|3<br>4|6|

#### Hints and Guidelines

The first step is to read the input. After this **create** a method, but this time be careful when **declaring** to give it the correct **type** of data, we want the method to return, which is **`double`**.

The next step is to **invoke the new** method from the **`Main()`** method and to **write down the return value in a suitable variable**.
