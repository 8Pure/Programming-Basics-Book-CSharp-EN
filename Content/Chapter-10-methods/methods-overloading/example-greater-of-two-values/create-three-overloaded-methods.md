#### Creating the Methods

We need to create three methods with the same name and different signatures. First we create a method, which will compare integers.

Following the logic of the previous method we create another one with the same name, but this one will compare characters.

The next method we need to create will compare strings. The logic here is a bit different from the previous two methods because variables of type **`string`** can not be compared with the operators **`<`** and **`>`**. We will use the method **`CompareTo(â€¦)`**, which returns a numerical value: larger than 0 (the compared object is larger), smaller than 0 (the compared object is smaller) and 0 (the two objects are the same).
