### Method Signature

In programming **the way** you can **identify** a method is through **the couple of elements** of its declaring â€“ **name** of the method and **a list** containing its parameters. These two elements determine its **specification**, the so invoked **signature** of the method.

In this example the methods signature is its name (**`Print`**), and also its parameter (**`string text`**).

If our program has **methods with the same names**, but with **different signatures**, we can say that we have **method overloading**.
