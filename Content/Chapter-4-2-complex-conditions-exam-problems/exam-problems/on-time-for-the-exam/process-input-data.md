#### Processing the Input Data

According to the assignment, we expect **four** rows containing different **integers** to be passed. Examining the provided parameters, we can use the **`int`** type, as it is suitable for the expected values. We simultaneously **read** the input data and **parse** the string value to the selected data type for **integer**.

Examining the expected output, we can create variables that contain the different output data types, in order to avoid using the so called **"magic strings"** in the code.
