#### Calculating Time Difference

Finally, we need to understand and print **what is the time difference between exam start time and student arrival time**, as well as whether this time difference indicates time of arrival **before or after the exam start**.

We check whether the time difference is **more than** one hour, in order to print hours and minutes in the required **format**, or **less than** one hour, in order to print **only minutes** as a format and description. 

We also need to do one more check - whether the time of student's arrival is **before** or **after** the exam start time.
