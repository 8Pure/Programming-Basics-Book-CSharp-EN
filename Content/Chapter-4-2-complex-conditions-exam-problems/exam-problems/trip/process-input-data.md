### Tips and Tricks

Typically, as for the other tasks, we can separate the solution into the following parts: reading the input data, doing calculations, printing the result.

#### Processing the Input Data

While reading carefully the requirements, we understand that we expect **two** rows of input data. The first parameter is a **real number**, for which we need to pick an appropriate variable type. For higher level of calculation accuracy we can pick **`decimal`** as a variable for the budget and - **`string`** for the season.

<table><tr><td><img src="/assets/alert-icon.png" style="max-width:50px" /></td>
<td>Always take into consideration what **value type** is passed in the input data, as well as what type these need to be converted to, in order for the program conditions to work properly!</td>
</tr></table>

**Example**: When you need to do money calculations in a task, use **`decimal`** for higher level of accuracy.
