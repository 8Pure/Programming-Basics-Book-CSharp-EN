#### Condition for Division and Modular Division

From the requirements we can see that for **summing up** (**`+`**), **subtraction** (**`-`**) or **multiplying** (**`*`**) the expected output has the same structure: **"{n1} {operator} {n2} = {output} â€“ {even/odd}"**, whereas for **division** (**`/`**) and **modular division** (**`%`**) the output has a different structure.
