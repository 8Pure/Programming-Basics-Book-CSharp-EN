## Nested Conditions

```csharp
if (condition1)
{
    if (condition2)
        // body; 
    else
        // body;
}
```

<table><tr><td><img src="/assets/alert-icon.png" style="max-width:50px" /></td>
<td>Remember that it is not a good practice to write **deeply nested conditional statements** (with more than three levels of nesting). Aviod nesting of more than three conditional statements inside one another. This complicates the code and makes its reading and understanding difficult.</td>
</tr></table>
