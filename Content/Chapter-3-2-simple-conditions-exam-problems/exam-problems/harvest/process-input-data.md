### Hints and Guidelines

In order to solve the task, we will read the input data. Then, we will write a few conditional statements and do some calculations. Finally, we will print the result.

#### Processing the Input Data and Doing the Calculations

First we have to **check** what **the input data** will be, so that we can choose what **variables** we will use.

To solve the problem, based on **the input data**, we have to **calculate** how many **litres of wine** will be produced. From the task requirements, we see that in order to **calculate** the quantity of **wine in litres**, we firstly have to find **the quantity of grapes in kilograms**, which will be received from the harvest. For that, we will **declare** a **variable** that stores a **value**, equal to **40%** of the result from the **multiplication** of the vineyard area by the quantity of grapes, which is extracted from 1 sq. m.

After having done these calculations, we are ready to **calculate the quantity of wine in litres** that will be produced from the harvest as well. For that, we **declare** one more **variable** that stores that **quantity**, which in order to calculate, we have to **divide the quantity of grapes in kg by 2.5**.
