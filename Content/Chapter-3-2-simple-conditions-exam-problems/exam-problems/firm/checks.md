#### Conditional execution and Printing the Output Data

After having done the calculations that are needed to find the value of **the working hours**, now we have to check whether these hours are **enough or some of them are left**.

If **the time is enough**, we print the result that is specified in the task requirements, which in this case is the difference between **the working hours and the hours needed** for finishing the project. 

If **the time is not enough**, we print the additional hours that are needed for finishing the project. They equal the difference between **the hours for the project** and **the total working hours**.
