### Hints and Guidelines

We will read the input data and depending on the distance, we will choose the cheapest transport. To do that, we will write a few conditional statements.

#### Processing the Input Data

In the task, we are given **information about the input and output data**. Therefore, in the first **two lines** from the solution, we will declare and initialize the two **variables** that are going to store **the values of the input data**. 
**The first line** contains **an integer** and that is why the declared variable will be of type **`int`**. **The second line** contains **a word**, therefore, the variable will be of type **`string`**.

Before starting with the conditional statements, it is necessary that we **declare** a **variable** that stores the value of **the price of the transport**.
