#### Calculating taxi rate

After having **declared and initialized** the input data and the variable that stores the value of the price, we have to decide which **conditions** of the task have to be **checked first**. 

The task specifies that the rates of two of the vehicles **do not depend** on whether it is **day** or **night**, but the rate of one of the transports (taxi) **depends**. This is why the **first condition** will be whether it is **day or night**, so that it is clear which rate the taxi will be **using**. To do that, we **declare one more variable** that stores **the value of the taxi rate**.

In order to calculate **the taxi rate**, we will use conditional statement of type **`if-else`** and through it, the variable for the price of the taxi will store its **value**.
