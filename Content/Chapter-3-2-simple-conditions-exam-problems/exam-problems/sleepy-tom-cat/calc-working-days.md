#### Calculating the working days

To solve the task, **first** we have to calculate **the total minutes** the owner of Tom is playing with him. We see that not only does the sleepy cat has to play with his owner during **the holidays**, but also during **the working days**. **The number** that we read from the console refers to **the holidays**. 

Out next step is with the help of that number, to **calculate** how many **the working days** of the owner are, as without them, we cannot receive **the total minutes for play**. As the total number of days per year is **365** *and the number of holidays is **X**, that means that the number of working days is **365 - X***. *The difference* we store in a new variable that  **only** stores this **value**.
