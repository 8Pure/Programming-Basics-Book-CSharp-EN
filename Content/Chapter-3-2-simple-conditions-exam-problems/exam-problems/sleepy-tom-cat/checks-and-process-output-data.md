#### Conditional execution

The time for games is already calculated, which leads us to the **next** step - **comparing** the **time for play** of Tom with the **norm** on which depends whether the cat can sleep well. For that we will use an **`if-else`** conditional statement. In the **`if` clause** we will check whether **the time for play is more than 30 000** (the norm).

#### Processing the Output Data

Whatever the **result** of the conditional statement is, we have to print how much **the difference in hours and minutes** is. We will do that with a **placeholder** and the variables that store the values of the hours and the minutes, as the formatting will be according to the task requirements for output. ****
