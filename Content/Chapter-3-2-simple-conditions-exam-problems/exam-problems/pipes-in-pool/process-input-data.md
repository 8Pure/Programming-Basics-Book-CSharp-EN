### Tips and Tricks

In order to solve the task, we read the input data, write a few conditional statements, do some calculations and print the result. 

#### Processing the Input Data

From the task requirements we note that our program must have **four lines** from which we read **the input data**. The first **three** consist of **integers** and that is why the **variables** that will store their values will be of **`int`** type. We know that the **fourth** line will be a **floating-point number**, therefore, the variable we use will be of **`double`** type.

Out next step is to **declare and initialize** a variable in which we are going to calculate with how many **liters** the pool has **filled up** for the time the worker was **absent**. We do the calculations by **summing** the values of the flow rates of the **two pipes** and **multiplying** them by the **hours** that are given as input data.
