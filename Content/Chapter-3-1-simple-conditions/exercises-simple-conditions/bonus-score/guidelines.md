#### Tips and Tricks

We can calculate the basic and additional bonus points with a series of **`if-else-if-else`** conditions. For **the main bonus points we have 3 cases** (when the entered number is up to 100, between 100 and 1000 and larger than 1000), and for **extra bonus points - 2 more cases** (when the number is even and odd).
