#### Creating a New C# Project

We create **a new project** in the existing Visual Studio solution. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click on **Solution 'Simple-Conditions'**. Then choose [**Add**] -> [**New Project**]:
 
 ![](/assets/chapter-3-images/09.Excellent-result-01.png)

A dialog box will open for selecting a project. Choose **C # console application** and specify a name, for example "Excellent-Result":
 
 ![](/assets/chapter-3-images/09.Excellent-result-02.png)
 
Now we have a solution with one console application in it. What remains is to write the code to solve the problem.
