## Exercises: Simple Conditions

Now let's practice the lessons learned in this chapter with a few exercises.

### Empty Visual Studio solution (Blank Solution)

We create a (**Blank Solution**) in Visual Studio to organize better the task solutions from the exercise - each task will be in a separate project and all projects will be in a common solution.

We run Visual Studio and create a new **Blank Solution:** [**File**] -> [**New**] -> [**Project**].

Choose from the dialog box [**Templates**] -> [**Other Project Types**] -> [**Visual Studio Solutions**] -> [**Blank Solution**] and give an appropriate project name, for example: “Simple-Conditions”:

Now we have an empty Visual Studio Solution (no projects in it):
