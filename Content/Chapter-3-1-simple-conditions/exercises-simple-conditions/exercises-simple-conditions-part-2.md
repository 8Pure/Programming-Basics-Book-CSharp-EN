# Exercises: Simple Conditions

Now let's **practice** the lessons learned in this chapter about of conditional statements **`if`** and **`if-else`**. We will solve a few **practical exercises**.

## Empty Visual Studio Solution (Blank Solution)

At the start we create a **Blank Solution** in Visual Studio to organize better the task solutions from the exercise – each task will be in a separate project and all projects will be in a common solution.

We run Visual Studio and create a new **Blank Solution:** [**File**] -> [**New**] -> [**Project**].

Choose from the dialog box [**Templates**] -> [**Other Project Types**] -> [**Visual Studio Solutions**] -> [**Blank Solution**] and give an appropriate project name, for example: “Simple-Conditions”:

Now we have an **empty Visual Studio Solution** (no projects in it):

We will use this solution to create a **separate project** for each of the problems, which we will solve as exercises in this chapter.
