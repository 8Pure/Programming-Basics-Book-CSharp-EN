### Problem: Summing Up Seconds

Three athletes finish in a particular number of **seconds** (between **1** and **50**). Write a program that introduces the times of the contestants and calculates their **total time** in "minutes:seconds" format. Seconds need to be **zeroed at the front** (2 -> "02", 7 -> "07", 35 -> "35").
