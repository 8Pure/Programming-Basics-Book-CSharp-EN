#### Tips and Tricks

We read the input data, and we can add **`ToLower()`** function when we read the measure units, which will make all letters small. As we can see from the table in the condition, we can only do converting **between meters and some other measure unit**. Then, first we have to calculate the number for converting in meters. That's why, we need to make a set of checks to define the input unit and then the output unit.
