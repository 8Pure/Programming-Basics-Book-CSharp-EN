#### Tips and Tricks

As usual, first we need to add a **new C # console project** to the existing solution. For the code of the program we need a single **`if-else`** construction. You can partially help with the code from the picture that is deliberately blurred to think about how to write it yourself:

When we are done with the implementation of the solution, we **run** the program with [**Ctrl + F5**] and test it:
