**We order the following controls** in the form:
* One box for entering a number (**`NumericUpDown`**)
* One drop-down list with currencies (**`ComboBox`**)
* Text block for the result (**`Label`**) 
* Several inscriptions (**`Label`**)

We set the **sizes** and their properties to look like the picture below:
