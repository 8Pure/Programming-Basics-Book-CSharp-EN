#### Tips and Tricks

Again, first we add **a new C # console project** in the existing solution. In the **`static void Main ()`** method, we have to write the program code. Checking if the given number is even can be done with the operator **`%`**, which will return the **remainder from an integer divided by 2** as follows: **`var isEven = (num % 2 == 0)`**.

Now we **run** the program with [**Ctrl + F5**] and test it:
