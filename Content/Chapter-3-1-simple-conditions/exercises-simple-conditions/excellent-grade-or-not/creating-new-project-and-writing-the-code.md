#### Starting a New C# Project and Writing the Program Code

First we create **a new C# console project** in the **Simple-Conditions** solution.

  - We click on the solution in Solution Explorer and choose [**Add**] -> [**New Project**].
 
  - We choose [**Visual C#**] -> [**Windows**] -> [**Console Application**] and specify a name, for example: “Excellent-or-Not”.
 
Now we have to **write the code** of the program. You can get help by using the sample code from the picture:
