## Comparing Numbers

In programming, we can compare values using the following **operators**:

* Operator **`<`** (less than)
* Operator **`>`** (greater than)
* Operator **`<=`** (less than or equals)
* Operator **`>=`** (greater than or equals)
* Operator **`==`** (equals)
* Operator **`!=`** (different from)

When compared, the result is a boolean value **true** or **false**, depending on whether the result of the comparison is true or false.

### Examples for comparing numbers

Note that when printing the **true** and **false** values in C # language, they are printed with a capital letter, respectively **True** and **False**.
