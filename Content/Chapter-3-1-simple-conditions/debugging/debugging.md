## Debugging

So far we wrote a lot of code, and there were some mistakes in it, right? Now we will show a tool that can help us to find mistakes easier.

### What is "debugging"?

**Debugging** is the „**attach**“ process to the running program, which allows us to track step by step the process. We can track **line by row** what happens to our program, what path it follows, what are the values of defined variables at each step of debugging, and many other things that allow us to detect errors (**bugs**).
