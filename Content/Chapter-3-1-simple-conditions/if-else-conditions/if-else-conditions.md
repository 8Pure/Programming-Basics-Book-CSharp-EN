## The if-else statement

The **`if`** construction may also contain an **`else`** clause to give a specific action in case the boolean expression (which is set at the beginning **`if (boolean expression)`** ) returns a negative result (**`false`**). Built this way, **the conditional construction** is called **`if-else`** and its behavior is as follows: if the result of the condition is **positive** (**`true`**) - we perform some actions, a when it is **negative** (**`false`**) - others. The format of the construction is:

```csharp
if (condition)
{
    // condition body;
}
else
{
    // Ðµlse construction body;
}

```
