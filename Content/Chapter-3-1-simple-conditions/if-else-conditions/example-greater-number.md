### Example: The Larger Number

Write a program that reads from the console two integers and takes the larger of them.

Our first task is to **read** the two numbers from the console. Then, with a simple **`if-else`** statement, combined with the **operator for greater than** (**`>`**), we do check. Part of the code is deliberately blurred, so you can test what you learned so far.
