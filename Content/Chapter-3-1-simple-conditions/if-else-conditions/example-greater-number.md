### Example: the larger number

Write a program that reads from the console two integers and takes the larger of them.

Our first task is to **read** the two numbers from the console. Then, with a simple **`if-else`** construction, combined with the **operator for greater than** (**`>`**), we do check. Part of the code is deliberately blurred to test what we have learned so far.
