# Chapter 3.1. Simple Conditions

In this chapter, we will discuss the **conditional statements in the C # language**, through which our program may have different effects, depending on a condition. We'll explain the syntax of conditional operators for checks (**`if`** and **`if-else`**) with appropriate examples and we will see in what range a variable (its **scope**) lives. Finally, we will go through **debugging** techniques to track the path that runs through our program during implementation.
