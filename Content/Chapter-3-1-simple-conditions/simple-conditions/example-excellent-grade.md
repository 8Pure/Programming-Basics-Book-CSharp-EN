### Example: excellent grade

We read the grade from the console and check if it's excellent (**`≥ 5.50`**).

Test the code from the example locally. Try entering different grades, for example **4.75**, **5.49**, **5.50** and **6.00**. For grades **less than 5.50**, the program will not give any output, however if the grade is **5.50 or greater**, the output would be "**Excellent!**".
