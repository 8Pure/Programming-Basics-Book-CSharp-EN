### Loop Step Explanation

**The step** is that **part** of the **`for`** loop construct that tells **how** much to **increase** or **decrease** the value of its **leading** variable. It is declared the last in the skeleton of the **`for`** loop.

Most often, we have **a size of `1`**, and in this case, instead of writing **`i += 1`** or **`i -= 1`**, we can use the **`i++`** or **`i--`** operators. If we want our step to be **different than 1**, when increasing, we use the **`i +=` + `step size`**, and when decreasing, the **`i -=` + `step size`**. In step 10, the loop would look like this:

Here is a series of sample problems, the solution of which will help us better understand the use of **the step** in **`for`** loop.
