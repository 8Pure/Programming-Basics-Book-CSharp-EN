### Example: Numbers N...1 

Write a program that prints the numbers from **n to 1 in reverse order** (step -1). For example, **if n = 100**, the result will be: **100, 99, 98, â€¦, 3, 2, 1**.

We can solve the problem in the following way:

  * We read the number **`n`** from the console input.
  * We create a **`for` loop** by assigning **`int i = n`**.
  * We reverse the condition of the loop: **`i >= 1`**.
  * We define the size of the step: **-1**.
  * In **the body of the loop**, we print the value of the current step.
