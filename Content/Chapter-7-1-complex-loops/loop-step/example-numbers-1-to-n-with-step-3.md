### Example: Numbers 1...N with Step 3 

Write a program that prints the numbers **from 1 to n** with **step 3**. For example, **if n = 100**, the result will be: **1, 4, 7, 10, â€¦, 94, 97, 100**.

We can solve the task through the following sequence of actions (algorithm):

  * We read the number **`n`** from the console input.
  * We run a **`for` loop** from **1** to **`n`** with step size **3**.
  * In **the body of the loop**, we print the value of the current step.
