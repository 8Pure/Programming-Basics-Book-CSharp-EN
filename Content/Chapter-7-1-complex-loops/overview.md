# Chapter 7.1. Complex Loops

Once we have learned what the loops are and what **the `for` loops** serve, now is coming to have a look at **other types of loops** as well as some **more complex loops constructions**. They will expand our knowledge and help us solve difficult and challenging problems. In particular, we will discuss how to use the following program constructs:

  * loops **with step**
  * **`while`** loops
  * **`do-while`** loops
  * **infinite** loops

In the current chapter, we will also understand what the operator **`break`** is and **how** to **break** a loop. Also, using the **`try-catch`** construct, we will learn to keep track of **errors** during our program's execution.
