### Infinite Loop Explanation

An infinite loop we call this loop, which **repeats infinitely** the performance of its body. In **`while`** and **`do-while`** loops, the end check is a conditional expression that **always** returns **`true`**. Infinite **`for`** occurs when there is **no condition to end**.
