### Operator Break

We already know that the infinite loop performs a certain code infinitely, but what if we want at some point under a given condition to go out of the loop? The help comes from the operator **`break`**.

<table><tr><td><img src="/assets/alert-icon.png" style="max-width:50px" /></td>
<td>The operator <b><code>break</code></b> stops the execution of the loop at the time it is called and continues from the first line after the end of the loop. This means that the current iteration of the loop will not be completed, accordingly, the rest of the code in the body of the loop will not be executed.</td>
</tr></table>
