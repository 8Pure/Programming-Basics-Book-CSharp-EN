#### Break in Infitine Loop Implementation

Here is an example implementation of the idea:

Note: Although the code above is correct, it will not work if the user enters text instead of numbers, such as "**Invalid number**". Then parsing the text to a number will break and the program will display **an error message (exception)**. How to deal with this problem and how to capture and process exceptions through **the `try-catch` construction** will be learned later.
