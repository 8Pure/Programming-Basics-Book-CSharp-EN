## Do-while Loop

The next loops we'll meet is **`do-while`**. By structure, it resembles **`while`**, but there is a significant difference between them. It is that **`do-while`** will execute its body **at least once**. Why is this happening? In the **`do-while`** loop construction, **the condition** is always checked **after** the body, which ensures that **the first loop rotation will execute** the code and **the check for the end of the loop** will be applied to each subsequent iteration of the **`do-while`**.

Here is following the usual set of sample problems, the solution of which will help us better understand the **`do-while`** loops.
