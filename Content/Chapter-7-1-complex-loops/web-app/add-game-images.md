#### Add Game Images

The next thing is to **add the images** for the game.

From [**Solution Explorer**] create folder **images** in the root directory of the project. We use the menu [**Add**] &rarr; [**New Folder**].

Now we add the **game images** (they are part of the project files for this project and can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/SoftUni/Programming-Basics-Book-CSharp-BG/tree/master/assets/chapter-7-assets)). We copy them from Windows Explorer and put them in the **images** folder in [**Solution Explorer**] in Visual Studio with **copy/paste**.
