#### Test the Application - I

Start the project with [**Ctrl + F5**] and enjoy it. It is expected to generate a random 9-to-3 playing field with fruits and visualize it on the web page through a series of pictures:

Now the game is sort of done: the playing field is randomly generated and rendered successfully (if you have not made a mistake somewhere). It remains to realize the essence of the game: **shooting the fruits**.
