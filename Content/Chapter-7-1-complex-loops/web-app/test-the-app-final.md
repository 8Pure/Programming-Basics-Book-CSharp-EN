#### Testing the Application - Final

After changing the code in the view, let's start with [**Ctrl + F5**] and **test** the game again:

![](/assets/chapter-7-images/15.Fruits-16.png)

This time, when you hit a dynamite, the right picture should appear and allow only the "new game" action (the [**New Game**] button).

Was it complicated? Did you manage to make the game? If you have not succeeded, relax, this is a relatively complex project that includes a great deal of non-studied matter. If you want the web game to pass through your hands, **watch the video** at the beginning of this chapter and follow the steps. There the app is made live with a lot of explanations. Or ask for specific issues in the **forum of SoftUni**: https://softuni.bg/forum.
