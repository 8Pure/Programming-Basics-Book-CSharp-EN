## Nested Loops and Break Operator

Once we have learned what **the nested loops** are and how the **`break`** operator works, it is time to figure out how they work together. For a better understanding, let's step by step write **a program** that should make all possible combinations of **pairs of numbers**. The first number of the combination is rising from 1 to 3 and the second one is decreasing from 3 to 1. The problem must continue to run until **`i + j`** is not equal to 2 (**`i = 1`** and **`j = 1`**).

The desired result is:
