### What is try-catch?

The **`try-catch`** construction is used to **capture and handle exceptions (errors)** during program execution.

In programming, **exceptions** are a notification of an event that violates the normal operation of a program. Such exceptional events **interrupt the execution** of our program, and it is looking for something to process the situation. If it does not find it, the exception is printed on the console. If found, **the exception is processed** and the program continues its normal execution. After a while, we'll see how this happens.

When an exception occurs, it is said that the exception was **"thrown" (throw exception)**. That is where the expression **"catch exception"** comes from.
