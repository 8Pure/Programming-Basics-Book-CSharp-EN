#### Reading the Input Data

The solution of this problem,like the previous one can also be splited into three parts â€“ **reading** input data , **processing** and **outputting** the result.

We start again with the choice of appropriate **data types** and names of the variables. For the Lilly's years (**`age`**) and the unit price of the toy (**`presentPrice`**) in the description is given, that they will be **integer numbers**. That's why we will use **`int` type**. For the price of the washing machine (**`priceOfWashingMachine`**) we know, that it is **real number and we choose `double`**. Of course, we can skip the explicit specification of type, by using **`var`**. In the above code we **declare** and **initialize** (assign value) the variables.
