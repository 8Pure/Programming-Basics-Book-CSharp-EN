#### Reading the Input Data

The solution of this problem, like the previous one, can also be split into three parts â€“ **reading** the input data, **processing** them and **printing the output**.

We start again by selecting the appropriate **data types** and names of variables. For the Lilly's years (**`age`**) and the unit price of the toy (**`presentPrice`**) the description requires **integers**. That's why we will use **`int` type**. For the price of the washing machine (**`priceOfWashingMachine`**) we know that it is **real number and we choose `double`**. Of course, we can skip the explicit specification of type, by using **`var`**. In the above code we **declare** and **initialize** (assign value to) the variables.
