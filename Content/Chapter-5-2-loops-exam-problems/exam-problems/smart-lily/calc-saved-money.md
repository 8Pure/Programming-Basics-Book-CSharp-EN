#### Calculating Saved Money

![](/assets/chapter-5-2-images/02.Smart-lilly-03.png)

With **`for` loop** we iterate through every Lily's birthday. When the leading variable is **even  number**, that means Lily **has received money** and we add this money to her total savings. At the same time we **subtract 1 lev** - the money , that her brother takes. Then we **increase** the value of the variable **`moneyForBirthday`**, ie. we increase by 10 the sum, which she will receive on her next birthday. Iversely, when the leading variable is **odd number**, we increase the count of **toys**. We do the parity check by **division with remainder** (**`%`**) **by 2** - when the remainder is 0, the figure is even, and the remainder 1 is odd.

We also add the money from the sold toys to the Lily's savings.
