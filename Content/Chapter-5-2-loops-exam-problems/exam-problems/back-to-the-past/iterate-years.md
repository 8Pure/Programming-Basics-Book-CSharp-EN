#### Iterate years


Using a **`for` loop** , we will iterate through all years. We **start from 1800** â€“ the year in that Ivancho returns, and we reach the **year until he must live**. We check in the loop if the current year is **even** or **odd**. We do this through **division with remainder** (**`%`**) by 2. If the year is **even**, we subtract from **`heritage`** **12000**, and if is **odd**, we subtract from **`heritage`** **12000 + 50 * (years).
