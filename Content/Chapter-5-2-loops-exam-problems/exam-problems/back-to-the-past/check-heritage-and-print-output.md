#### Check Heritage and Print Output

Finally we need to print out the results by checking **if the `heritage`** was enough to live without working or not. If `heritage` is **positive number** , we print: „**`Yes! He will live a carefree life and will have {N} dollars left.`**“, and if is **negative number** : „**`He will need {М} dollars to survive.`**“. Do not forget to format the sum to the second decimal point.

**Hint**: Consider using the **`Math.Abs(…)`** function when printing the output, if the heritage is not enough.
