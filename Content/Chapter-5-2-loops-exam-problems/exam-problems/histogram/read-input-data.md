#### Reading the Input Data
  
Before we proceed to the reading of the input data, we must **declare the variables**, in which we will store them. This means choosing the right type of data and appropriate names.

In the variable **`n`** we will store the count of numbers, which we will read from the console. We choose **`int` type**, because in the description is said, that **`n` is integer number** within the range from 1 to 1000. For the variables, in which we will store the percentages, we choose **`double` type**, because **they are not expected** to be always **integer numbers** . Additionally, we declare the variables **`cntP1`**, **`cntP2`** etc., in which we will keep count of the numbers from the respective group, and we choose again **`int` type**.

After we have declared the needed variables, we can read the number **`n`** from the console:
