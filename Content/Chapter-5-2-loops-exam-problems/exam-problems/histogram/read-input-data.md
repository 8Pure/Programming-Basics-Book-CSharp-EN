#### Reading the Input Data
  
Before we proceed to reading the input data, we must **declare the variables**, in which we will store it. This means choosing the right data type and appropriate names.

In the variable **`n`** we will store the count of numbers that we will read from the console. We choose **`int` type**, because in the description it say, that **`n` is an integer** within the range from 1 to 1000. For the variables in which we will store the percentages, we choose **`double` type**, because **they are not expected** to always be **integers**. Additionally, we declare the variables **`cntP1`**, **`cntP2`** etc., in which we will keep the count of the numbers from the respective group, and we choose again **`int` type**.

After we have declared the needed variables, we can read the number **`n`** from the console:
