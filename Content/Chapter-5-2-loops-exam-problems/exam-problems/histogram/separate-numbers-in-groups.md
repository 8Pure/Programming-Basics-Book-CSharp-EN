#### Distributing Numbers in Groups

To read and distribute each number in its corresponding group, we will use a **`for` loop** from **0** to **`n`** (count of numbers). Every iteration of the loop will read and distribute **one single** number (**`currentNumber`**) into its corresponding group. In order to determine if a number belongs to a group, we **perform a check in its respective range**. If the above is true, we increase the count of the numbers in the corresponding group (**`cntP1`**, **`cntP2`** etc.) by 1.
