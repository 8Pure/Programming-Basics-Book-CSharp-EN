#### Separate numbers in groups

To read and separate every number in its corresponding group, we will use **`for` loop** froom **0** to **`n`** (count of numbers). Every iteration of the loop will read and separate **one single** number (**`currentNumber`**) in its corresponding group. In order to determine if a number belongs to a group, we **perform a check in its respective range**. If it is -  we increase the count of the numbers in the corresponding group (**`cntP1`**, **`cntP2`** etc.) with 1.
