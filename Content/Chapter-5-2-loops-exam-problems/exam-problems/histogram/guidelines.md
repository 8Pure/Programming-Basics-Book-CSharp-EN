### Tips and Tricks

The program that solves this problem, we can split in three parts:

  * **Reading the input data** – in the current problem this includes reading of the number **n**, following by **n count integer numbers**, each on a single line.
  * **Processing the input data** – in this case that means allocating the numbers into groups and calculating the percentage breakdown by groups.
  * **Printing the output** – print the histogram on the console in the specified format.
  
Before we proceed forward, we will make a small deviation from the current topic, that is, we will briefly mention that in programming every variable is from some **type of data**. In this problem we will use the numeral types **`int`** for **integer numbers** and **`double`** for **real numbers**. Often, for making it easier, programmers miss the explicit specification of the type by replacing it with the keyword **`var`**.  For better understanding we will write the type in the variable declaration.

We will now proceed to the implementation of each of the above points.
