### Hints and Guidelines

We can split the program that solves this problem into three parts:

  * **Reading the input data** – in the current problem this includes reading of the number **n**, followed by **n count of integers**, each on a single line.
  * **Processing the input data** – in this case that means allocating the numbers into groups and calculating the percentage breakdown by groups.
  * **Printing the output** – printing the histogram on the console in the specified format.
  
Before we proceed, we will make a small deviation from the current topic, namely, we will briefly mention that in programming every variable has a certain **data type**. In this problem we will use the numeral types **`int`** for **integers** and **`double`** for **real numbers**. Often, to make it easier, programmers miss the explicit specification of the type by replacing it with the keyword **`var`**.  For better understanding we will write the type upon declaring the variables.

We will now proceed with the implementation of each of the above points.
