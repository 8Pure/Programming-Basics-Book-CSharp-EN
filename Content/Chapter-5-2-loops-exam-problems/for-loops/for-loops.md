Before we start working,it will be good to review again construction of **`for` loop**:

**For loops** consists of:
 * Initialization block in which the variable-counter is declared (**`var i`**) and its initial value is set.
 * Repeat condition (**`i <= 10`**), executing once, before every iteration of the loop.
 * Refreshing of the counter (**`i++`**) – this code is executed after each iteration.
 * Body of the loop - contains random block with source code.
