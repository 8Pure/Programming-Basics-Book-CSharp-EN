## For Loops

Before we start working, it will be good to review again the **`for` loop** construction:

**For loops** consist of:
 * Initialization block in which the variable-counter is declared (**`var i`**) and its initial value is set.
 * Repeat condition (**`i <= 10`**), executing once, before each iteration of the loop.
 * Restarting the counter (**`i++`**) â€“ this code is executed after each iteration.
 * Body of the loop - contains random block of source code.
