## Repetitions of Code Blocks (For Loop)

In programming it is often required **to perform a block of commands multiple times**. In order to do that, the so called **loops** are used. Let's examine an example of a **`for` loop** that passes sequentially through the numbers from 1 to 10 and prints them:

The loop starts with the **`for` operator** and passes through all values for a particular variable in a given interval, for example the numbers from 1 to 10 (included), and for each value it performs a series of commands.

Upon declaring the loop you can specify a **start value** and an **end value**. **The body of the loop** is usually enclosed in curly brackets **`{ }`** and represents a block of one or multiple commands. The figure below shows the structure of a **`for` loop**:

In most cases a **`for` loop** is run between **`1`** and **`n`** times (for example from 1 to 10). The purpose of the loop is to pass sequentially through the numbers 1, 2, 3, â€¦, n and for each of them to perform a particular action. In the examiple above, the **`i`** variable accepts values from 1 to 10 and the current value is printed in the body of the loop. The loop repeats 10 times and each of these repetitions is called an "**iteration**".
