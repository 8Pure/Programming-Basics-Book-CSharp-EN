# Example: Numbers from 1 to 100

Write a program that **prints the numbers from 1 to 100**. The program does not accept input and prints the numbers from 1 to 100 sequentially, one on each row.

## Tips and Tricks

We can solve the problem using a **`for` loop** , via which we will pass through the numbers from 1 to 100 using the **`i`** variable, and print the numbers in the body of the loop:

**Start** the program using [**Ctrl+F5**] and **test it**:
