### Blank Solution in Visual Studio

Create a **(Blank Solution)** in Visual Studio, in order to better organize the exercise tasks. The goal of this **blank solution** is to contain **one project for each task** in the exercises.

Set it up to **start the current project by default** (not the first one in the solution). Do that by right clicking on **Solution 'Loops'** -> [**Set StartUp Projectsâ€¦**] -> [**Current selection**].
