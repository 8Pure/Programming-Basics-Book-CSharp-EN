# Exercises: Repetitions \(Loops\)

Now that we are familiar with loops, it is time **to practice our newly acquired skills**, and as you know, this is achieved by a lot of code writing. Let's solve some **practical problems**.

## What We Learned in This Chapter?

We can repeat a code block using a `for`** loop**:

We can read a sequence of `n` numbers from the console this way:

## Blank Solution in Visual Studio

Before starting with the exercises, we shall create a **Visual Studio solution** with the idea to hold the code for each exercises problem in a **separate C# project** inside the solution.

Create a **(Blank Solution)** in Visual Studio:

Set it up to **start the current project by default** (not the first one in the solution). Do that by right clicking on **Solution 'Loops'** -> [**Set StartUp Projectsâ€¦**] -> [**Current selection**].

## The Problems

Now it's time to start working on the problems:

* [Problem: Element Equal to the Sum of the Rest](/Content/Chapter-5-1-loops/exercises-loops/half-sum-element.md)
* [Problem: Even / Odd Positions](/Content/Chapter-5-1-loops/exercises-loops/even-odd-positions.md)
* [Problem: Equal Pairs](/Content/Chapter-5-1-loops/exercises-loops/equal-pairs.md)
