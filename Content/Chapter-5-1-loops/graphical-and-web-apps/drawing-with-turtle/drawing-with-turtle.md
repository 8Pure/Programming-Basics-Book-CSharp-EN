# Exercises: Turtle Graphics GUI Application

In the current chapter we learned about **loops** as a programming construction that allows  to repeat a particular action or a group of actions multiple times. Now let's play with them. In order to do that, we will draw some figures that will consist of a large number of repeating graphical elements, but this time we will not do it in the console, but in a graphical environment using "**turtle graphics**". It will be interesting. And it is not hard at all. Try it!

## What Shall We Build?

The purpose of the following exercise is to play with a "move and rotate" **drawing library**, also known as **"turtle graphics"**. We will build a graphical application (GUI App) in which we will **draw various figures** by moving our **"turtle"** across the screen via operations like "move 100 positions ahead", "turn 30 degrees to the right", "move 50 more positions ahead". The application will look approximately like this:
