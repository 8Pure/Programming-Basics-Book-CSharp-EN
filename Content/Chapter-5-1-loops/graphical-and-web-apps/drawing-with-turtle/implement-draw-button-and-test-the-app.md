## Implementing the [Draw] Button

Double-click the [**Draw**] button in order to add the code that will be executed upon its pressing. Write the following code:

![](/assets/chapter-5-images/13.Turtle-graphics-07.png)

This code moves and rotates the turtle that is initially in the center of the screen (in the middle of the form), and draws an equilateral triangle. You can edit it and play with it.

## Testing the Application

**Start** the application by pressing [**Ctrl+F5**]. Test if it works (press the [**Draw**] button a few times):
