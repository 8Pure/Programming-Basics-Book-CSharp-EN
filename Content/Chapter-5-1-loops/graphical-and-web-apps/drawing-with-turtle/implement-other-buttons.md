## Implementing the [**Reset**] Button

Now let's write the code for the other two buttons. The purpose of the [**Reset**] button is to delete the graphics and to start drawing from the beginning:

![](/assets/chapter-5-images/13.Turtle-graphics-11.png)

## Implementing the [**Show / Hide Turtle**] Buttons 

The purpose of the [**Show / Hide Turtle**] button is to show or hide the turtle: 

![](/assets/chapter-5-images/13.Turtle-graphics-12.png)

Once again, **start** the application by [**Ctrl+F5**] and test whether it works correctly.
