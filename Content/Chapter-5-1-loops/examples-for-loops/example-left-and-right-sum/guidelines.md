#### Tips and Tricks

We will first input the number **n**, after that the first **n** numbers (**left** half) and sum them up. We will then proceed with inputting more **n** numbers (**the right** half) and sum them up. We calculate the **difference** between the sums by absolute value: **`Math.Abs(leftSum - rightSum)`**. If the difference is **0**, print **"Yes" + the sum**, otherwise - print **"No" + the difference**.
