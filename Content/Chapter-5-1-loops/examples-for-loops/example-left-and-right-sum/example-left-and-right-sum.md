### Example: Left and Right Sum

Write a program that converts **2 \* n integers** and checks whether **the sum of the first n integers** (left sum) equals the **sum of the second n numbers** (right sum). In case the sums are equal, print **"Yes" + the sum**, otherwise print **"No" + the difference**. The difference is calculated as a positive number (by absolute value). The format of the output must be identical to the one in the examples below.

#### Sample Input and Output

| Input | Output | Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| 2<br>10<br>90<br>60<br>40 | Yes, sum = 100 | 2<br>90<br>9<br>50<br>50 | No, diff = 1 |
