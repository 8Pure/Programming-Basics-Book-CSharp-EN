#### Tips and Tricks

We input the numbers one by one and calculate the two **sums** (of the numbers on **even** positions and the numbers on **odd** positions). Identically to the previous problem, we calculate the absolute value of the difference and print the result (**"Yes" + the sum** in case of difference of 0 or **"No" + the difference** in any other case).
