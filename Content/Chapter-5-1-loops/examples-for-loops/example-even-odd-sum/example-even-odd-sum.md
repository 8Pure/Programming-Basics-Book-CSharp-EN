### Example: Even / Odd Sum

Write a program that inputs **n integers** and checks whether **the sum of the numbers on even positions** is equal to **the sum of the numbers on odd positions**. In case the sums are equal, print **"Yes" + the sum**, otherwise, print **"No" + the difference**. The difference is calculated by absolute value. The format of the output must be identical to the examples below.

#### Sample Input and Output

| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |
| 4<br>10<br>50<br>60<br>20 | Yes<br>Sum = 70 |
| 4<br>3<br>5<br>1<br>-2 | No<br>Diff = 1 |
| 3<br>5<br>8<br>1 | No<br>Diff = 2 |
