#### Tips and Tricks

We will first enter one number **`n`** (the number of integers that are about to be entered). We assign the current maximum **`max`** an initial neutral value, for example **-10000000000000** (or **`int.MinValue`**). Using a **`for` loop** that is iterated **n-1 times**, we read one integer **`num`** on each iteration. If the read number **`num`** is higher than the current maximum **`max`**, we assign the value of the **`num`** to the **`max`** variable. Finally, in **`max`** we must have stored the highest number. We print the number in the console.
