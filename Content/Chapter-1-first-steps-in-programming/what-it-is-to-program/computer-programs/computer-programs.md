### Computer programs

**Computer programs** represent **a sequence of commands**, which are written in a previously chosen **programming language**, like C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, C, C++, Swift, Go or another. In order to write commands, we have to know **the syntax and the semantics of the language** which we are working with, in our case - **C#**. That is why we are going to get familiar with the syntax and the semantics of the language  C#, and with programing generally, in the current book  by learning step by step code writing from the simpler to the more complex programming constructions.
