### Computer programs - compilation and execution

As we have already mentioned, the program is **a sequence of commands**, otherwise said, it describes a sequence of calculations, evaluations, iterations and all kinds of similar operations, which aim to accomplish some kind of result.

The program is written in a text format, and the text of the program itself is called **a source code**. It gets compiled to an **executable file** (for example **`Program.cs`** gets compiled to **`Program.exe`**) or it it is **executed directly** from the .NET environment.

The process of **compilation** of the code before  its execution is used only in compiled languages like C#, Java and C++. With **scripts and interpreted languages**, like JavaScript, Python and PHP, the source code gets executed step by step by an interpreter.
