### Computer Programs - Compiling and Execution

As we have already mentioned, a program is **a sequence of commands**, otherwise said, it describes a sequence of calculations, evaluations, iterations and all kinds of similar operations, which aim to accomplish some kind of result.

A program is written in a text format, and the text of the program is called **a source code**. It gets compiled into an **executable file** (for example **`Program.cs`** gets compiled to **`Program.exe`**) or it is **executed directly** from the .NET environment.

The process of **compilation** of the code before its execution is used only in compiled languages like C#, Java and C++. With **scripts and interpreted languages**, like JavaScript, Python and PHP, the source code gets executed step by step by an interpreter.
