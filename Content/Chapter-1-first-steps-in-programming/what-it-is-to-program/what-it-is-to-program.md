## What It Means "To Program"?

**To program** means to give commands to the computer, for example "*to play a sound*", "*to print something on the screen*" or "*to multiply two numbers*". When the commands are one after another, they are called **a computer program**. The text of computer programs is called **a program code** (or **a source code**, or even shorter - **code**).
