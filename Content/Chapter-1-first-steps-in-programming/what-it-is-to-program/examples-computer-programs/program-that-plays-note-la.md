#### Example: A Program That Plays the Musical Note "A"

Our first program is going to be a single C# command that plays the musical note "A" (432 Hz) with a duration of half a second (500 miliseconds):

```csharp
Console.Beep(432, 500);
```

In a short time we will find out how we can execute this command and hear the sound of the note, but for now let's just look at what the commands in programming represent. Let's get to know a couple more examples.
