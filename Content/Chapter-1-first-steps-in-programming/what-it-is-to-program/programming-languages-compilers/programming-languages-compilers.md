### Programming Languages, Compilers, Interpreters and Development Environments

**A programming language** is an artificial language (syntax for expression), meant for **giving commands** that we want the computer to read, process and execute. Through programming languages we write sequences of commands (**programs**), which **define what the computer should do**. The execution of computer programs can be done with **a compiler** or with **an interpreter**.

**The compiler** translates the code from programming language to **machine code**, as for each of the constructions (commands) in the code it chooses a proper, previously prepared fragment of machine code and in the meantime it **checks the text of the program for errors**. Together, the compiled fragments comprise the program into a machine code, as the microprocessor of the computer expects it. After the program has been compiled, it can be executed directly from the microprocessor in cooperation with the operating system. With compiler-based programming languages **the compilation of the program** is done mandatorily before its execution, and syntax errors (wrong commands) are found during compile time. Languages like C++, C#, Java, Swift and Go work with a compiler.

Some programming languages do not use a compiler and are being **interpreted directly** by a specialized software called an "interpreter". **The interpreter** is "**a program for executing programs**", written in some programming language. It executes the commands in the program one after another, as it understands not only a single command and sequences of commands, but also other language constructions (evaluations, iterations, functions, etc.). Languages like PHP, Python and JavaScript work with an interpreter and are being executed without being compiled. Due to the absence of previous compilation, in interpreted languages **the errors are being found during runtime**, after the program starts running, not previously.

**An environment for development** (Integrated Development Environment - **IDE**) is an union of traditional tools for development of software applications. In the development environment we write code, compile and execute the programs. Development environments integrate in them **a text editor** for writing code, **a programming language**, **a compiler or an interpreter** and **a runtime environment** for executing programs, **a debugger** for tracking the program and seeking out errors, **tools for user interface design** and other tools and add-ons.

**Environments for development** are convenient, because they integrate everything necessary for the development of the program, without the need to exit the environment. If we don't use an environment for development, we will have to write the code in a text editor, to compile it with a command in the console, to run it with another command in the console and to write more additional commands when needed, which is very time consuming. That is why most of the programmers use an IDE in their everyday work.

For programming with **the C# language** the most commonly used IDE is **Visual Studio**, which is  developed and distributed freely by Microsoft and can be downloaded from: https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/. Alternatives of Visual Studio are **Rider** (https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) and **MonoDevelop** / **Xamarin Studio** (http://www.monodevelop.com) and **SharpDevelop** (http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/). In the current book, we are going to use the development environment Visual Studio.
