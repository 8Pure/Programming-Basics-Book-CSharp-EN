## Test the programs that play notes

Now, after **you know how to run programs**, you can test your example programs above, which play musical notes. Have some fun, try these programs out. Try to change them and play with them. Exchange the command **`Console.WriteLine("Hello C#");`** with the command **`Console.Beep(432, 500);`** and start the program. Check if the sound of your computer is on and whether its turned up. If you work in an online environment, you will not hear a sound, because the program is not executued on your computer, but elsewhere.
