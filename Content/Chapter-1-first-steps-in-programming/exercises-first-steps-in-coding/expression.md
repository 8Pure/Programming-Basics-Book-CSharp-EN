### Problem: console application “Expression”

Write a C# console program, which **calculates** and **prints** the value of the following numerical expression:

<p align="center"> (3522 + 52353) * 23 - (2336 * 501 + 23432 - 6743) * 3 </p>

Warning: **it is not allowed to previously calculate the value** (for example with Windows Calculator).

#### Hints and Guidelines

We make **a new  C# console project** with name "**Expression**".	We find the method **``static void Main(string[] args)``** and **go into its body** between **`{`** and **`}`**. After that we have to **write the code**, which calculates the above numerical expression and prints its value on the console. We put the above numerical expression inside the brackets of the command **``Console.WriteLine(…)``**:

We start the program with [**Ctrl+F5**] and check if the result is the same as the one in the picture:
