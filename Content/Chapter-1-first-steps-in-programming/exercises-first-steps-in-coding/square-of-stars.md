# \* Problem: A Square Made Out of Stars

Write a C# console program that **reads** from the console **an integer N** and **prints** on the console **a square made out of N stars**, like in the examples below.

## Sample Input and Output

| Input  |    Outup   	| Input  |    Output   	| Input  |    Output   	| 
|-----|-----------|-----|-----------|-----|----------|
|  3  	|<code>\*\*\*</code><br><code>\*&nbsp;\*</code><br><code>\*\*\*</code>|  4  |<code>\*\*\*\*</code><br><code>\*&nbsp;&nbsp;\*</code><br><code>\*&nbsp;&nbsp;\*</code><br><code>\*\*\*\*</code>| 5  	|<code>\*\*\*\*\*</code><br><code>\*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\*</code><br><code>\*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\*</code><br><code>\*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\*</code><br><code>\*\*\*\*\*</code>|

## Tips and Tricks

Create a new **console C# program**. To read the number N (2 ≤ N ≤100), use the following code:

Finish the program above, so that it prints a square, made out of stars. It might be necessary to use **`for`** loops. Look for information on the Internet.

**Attention**: this task is harder than the rest and is given now on purpose, and it's marked with a star, in order to provoke you to look for information on the Internet. This is one of the most important skills that you have to develop while you're learning programming: **looking for information on the Internet**. This is what you're going to do every day, if you work as a developer, so don't be scared, try it out.
