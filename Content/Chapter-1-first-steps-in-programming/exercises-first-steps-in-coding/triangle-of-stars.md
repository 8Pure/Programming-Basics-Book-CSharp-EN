# Problem: A Triangle Made Out of 55 Stars

Write a C\# console program that **prints a triangle made out of 55 stars** on 10 rows:

```
*
**
***
****
*****
******
*******
********
*********
**********
```

## Tips and Tricks

Create **a new console C\# application** with name “**`TriangleOf55Stars`**”. Inside it, write code that prints the triangle of stars, for example through 10 commands, as the ones pointed out below:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("*");
Console.WriteLine("**");
…
```

## Testing in the Judge System

Test your solution here: [https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/Practice/Index/503\#3](https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/Practice/Index/503#3).

Try to **improve your solution**, so that it doesn't have many repeating commands. Could it be done with a `for` loop? Did you find a smart solution \(for example with a loop\) of the previous task? With this task you can also use something similar, but a bit more complex \(two loops, one inside the other\). If you don't succeed, there is no problem, we will be learning loops in a few chapters and you will be reminded of this task then.
