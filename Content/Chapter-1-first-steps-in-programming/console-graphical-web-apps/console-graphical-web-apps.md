## Console, graphical and web applications

With **console applications**, as you can figure out yourselves, **all operations** for reading input and printing output are **done through the console**. There  **the input data is inserted**, which is read from the application, also in it, is **printed the output data** after or during the runtime of the program.

While the console application **uses the text console**, web applications **use web-based user interface**. To **receive their performance** are needed two things - **a web server** and **a web browser**, as **the browser** plays the main role in **the visualization of the data and the interaction with the user**. Web applications are much more pleasant for the user, they visually look better, and a mouse and touch screen can be used (for tablets and smartphones), but behind all of that stands programming. And this is why **we have to learn to program** and we have already made our first very little steps towards.

Graphical (GUI) applications have **a visual user interface**, directly into your computer or mobile device, without a web browser. Graphical applications (or otherwise said, desktop applications) **contain one or more graphical windows**, in which are situated certain **controllers** (text fields, buttons, pictures, tables and others), **serving for dialog** with the user in a more intuitive way. Similar to them are the mobile applications in your telephone or your tablet: we use forms, text fileds, buttons and other controls and we control them by programming code. This is why we are learning how to write code now: **the code is everywhere in the software development**.
