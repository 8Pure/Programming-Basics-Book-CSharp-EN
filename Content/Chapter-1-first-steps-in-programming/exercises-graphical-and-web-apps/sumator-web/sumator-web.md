### Web Application: "Sumator" (Calculator)

Now we are going to write something even more complex, but also more interesting: a web application that **calculates the sum of two numbers**. By **entering two numbers** in the first two text fields and pressing the [**Calculate**] button, **their sum is being calculated** and the result is shown in the third text field.

Pay attention that we are creating **a web-based application**. This is an application that is available through a web browser, just like your favorite email or news website. The web application is going to have a server side (back-end), which is written in the C# language with the ASP.NET MVC technology, and a client side (front-end), which is written in the HTML language (this is a language for visualization of information in a web browser). 
The web application is expected to look similarly to the following:

As a difference compared to console applications, which read and write the data in the form of a text in the console, web applications have **a web-based user interface**. Web applications **are being loaded from some Internet address** (URL) through a standard web browser. Users write input data in a page, visualized from the web browser, the data is processed on a web server and the results are shown again in a page of the web browser. For our web application we are going to use **the ASP.NET MVC technology**, which allows creating of **web applications with the programming language C#** in the development environment **Visual Studio**.
