### Web application: sumator for numbers

Now we are going to write something even more complex, but also more interesting: a web application that **calculates the sum of two numbers**. By **entering two numbers** in the first two text fields and pressing the button [**Calculate**], **their sum is being calculated** and the result is shown in the third text field.

Pay attention that we are creating **a web-bsed application**. This is an application, which is available through a web browser, just like your favorite email or news website. The web application is going to have a server side (back-end), which is written with the language C# with the technology ASP.NET MVC and the client side (front-end), which is written with the language HTML (this is a language for visualization of information in a web browser). 
The web application is expected to look similar to the following:

In difference to the console applications, which read and write the data in the form of a text in the console,  web applications have **a web-based user interface**. Web applications **are being loaded from some Internet address** (URL) through a standart web browser. The users write an input data in a page, visualized from the web browser, the data is processed on a web server and the results are shown again in the page of the web browser. For our web application we are going to use **the technology ASP.NET MVC**, which allows the creating of **web applications with the programming language C#** in the environment for development **Visual Studio**.
