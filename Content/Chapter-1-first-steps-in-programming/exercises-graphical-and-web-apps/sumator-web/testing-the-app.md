#### Testing the Application

The application is ready. We can start it with [**Ctrl+F5**] and test whether it works:

Does it look scary? **Don't be afraid!** We have a lot more to learn, to reach the level of knowledge and skills to write web-based applications freely like in the example above, as well as much bigger and much more complex ones. If you don't succeed, there is nothing to worry about, keep moving on. After some time you will remember with a smile how incomprehensible and exiting your first collision with web programming was. If you have problems with the example above, **watch the video** at the beginning of this chapter. The application is built live there, step by step with a lot of explanations. Or ask in **the SoftUni forum**: https://softuni.bg/forum.

The purpose of both of the above examples (graphical desktop application and web application) is not to teach you, but to make you dive a little deeper into programming, **to enhance your interest** towards software development and to inspire you to learn hard. **You have a lot to learn yet**, but it's interesting, isn't it?
