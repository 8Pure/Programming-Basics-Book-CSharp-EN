#### Solving the Problem and Retesting the Application

The problem comes from **the conversion of the text field into a number**. If the value inside the field **is not a number, the program throws an exception**. We can rewrite the code in order to fix this problem:

The code above **catches the errors when working with numbers** (it catches exceptions) and in case of an error **it gives a value `error`** in the field with the result. We start the program again with [**Ctrl+F5**] and try if it works. This time **by entering a wrong number the result is `error`** and the program doesn't break:

Is it complicated? It is normal to seem complex, of course. We are just beginning to get into programming. The example above requires much more knowledge and skills, which we are going to develop through this book and even afterwards. Just allow yourself to have some fun with desktop programming. If something doesn't work, watch **the video in the beginning of this chapter** or ask in **the SoftUni forum**: https://softuni.bg/forum. Or move on bravely forward to the next example or to the next chapter of the book. A time will come when it is going to be easy for you, but you really have to put **an effort and be persistent**. Programming is learnt slowly with lots and lots of practice.
