#### Writing the Program Code

Now it is time to write the code, which **sums the numbers** from the first two fields and **shows the result** in the third field. For this purpose we double click **the [Calculate] button**. The place, in which we write what is going to happen by clicking the button will be shown:

We write the following C# code between the opening and the closing brackets **`{ }`**, where the cursor is:

![](/assets/chapter-1-images/07.Numbers-sum-09.png)

This code **takes the first number** from the field **`textBox1`** and keeps it **in the variable `num1`**, keeps **the second number** from the field **`textBox2`** in **the variable `num2`**, afterwards it **sums `num1` and `num2` in the variable `sum`** and in the end **takes the text value of the variable `sum`** in the field **`textBoxSum`**.
