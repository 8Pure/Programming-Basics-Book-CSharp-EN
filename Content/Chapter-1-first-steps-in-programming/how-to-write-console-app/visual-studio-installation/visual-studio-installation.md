### How to Install Visual Studio Community

We begin with the installation of the integrated environment **Microsoft Visual Studio Community** (version 2017, latest as of June 2017).

The **Community** version of Visual Studio (VS) is distributed freely by Microsoft and can be downloaded from: [https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community). The installation is typical for Windows with [**Next**], [**Next**] and [**Finish**], but it's important to include the components for "**desktop development**" and "**ASP.NET**". It is not necessary to chagne the rest of the settings for the installation.

The next lines describe in details **the steps for the installation of Visual Studio** (version Community 2017). After we download the installation file and start it, the following screen appears:

Press the [**Continue**] button and you will see the screen bellow:

A screen with the installation panel of Visual Studio is being loaded.

Put a checkmark on [**Universal Windows Platform development**], [**.NET desktop development**] and [**ASP.NET and web development**], then press the [**Install**] button. Basically, this is everything.

The installation of Visual Studio begins, and a screen like the one bellow will appear:

After Visual Studio is installed, an informative screen will appear. Press the [**Launch**] button to start it.

Upon **starting VS** a screen appears like the one bellow. On it you can choose whether you will enter Visual Studio using a Microsoft account. For now, we choose to continue without being logged into our Microsoft account, and this is why we choose the option [**Not now, maybe later.**]. At a later point, if you have such an account, you may log in, and if you don't have one, and you have difficulties with its creation, you can always write in the forum of SoftUni: [https://softuni.bg/forum](https://softuni.bg/forum).

The next step is to choose **the color theme**, in which Visual Studio is visualized. The choice here lays completely on the preferences of the user and it doesn't matter which option will be chosen.

Press the [**Start Visual Studio**] button and the main view of Visual Studio Community will be displayed:

This is everything. We are ready to work with Visual Studio.

### Older versions of Visual Studio

You can use older versions of Visual Studio (for example version 2015 or 2013 or even 2010 or 2005), but **it is not recommended**, as they don't contain some of the newer options for development, and not all of the examples from the book will start.
