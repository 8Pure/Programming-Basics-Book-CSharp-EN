### Starting the program

To start the program, we press [**Ctrl + F5**]. If there aren't any errors, the program will be executed. The result will be written on the console (in the black window):

Notice, that we start it with **[Ctrl+F5]**, and not only **[F5]** or with the start button in Visual Studio. If we use **[F5]**, the program will run shortly and right afterwards the black window will disappear and we are not going to see the result.

Actually, the exit from the program is the following text message:

```csharp
Hello C#
```

The message "**Press any key to continue . . .**" is written additionally on the bottom row in the Visual Studio console after the program ends, in order to tell us to see the result from the execution and to press a button to close the console.
