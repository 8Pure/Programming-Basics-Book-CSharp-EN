## Example: creating a console application "Hello C#"

Let's get back to our console program. We already have Visual Studio and we can start it. Afterwards we create a new console project: [**File**] &rarr; [**New**] &rarr; [**Project**] &rarr; [**Visual C#**] &rarr; [**Windows**] &rarr; [**Console Application**].

We set **a meaningful name** to our program, for example **`HelloCSharp`**:

Visual Studio is going to create for us **an empty C# program**, which we have to finish writing (VS Solution with VS Project in it, with C# source file in it, with one C# class in it, with **`Main()`** method in it).
