### Testing the Program in the Judge System

Testing of the problems in this book is automated and is done through the Internet, using the **Judge System**: [https://judge.softuni.bg](https://judge.softuni.bg) website. The evaluation of the tasks is done immediately by the system. Each task goes through a sequence of tests, as every successfully passed test gives the points assigned for it. The tests that are applied to the tasks are hidden.

We can test the above program here: [https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/Practice/Index/503#0](https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/Practice/Index/503#0). We place the source code from the program in the black field and we choose **C# code**, the way it is shown:

We send our solution for evaluation using the [**Send**] button. The system gives a result back in a few seconds in the table with sent solutions. When necessary, we can press the button for renewing the results **[refresh]** in the upper right side of the table with sent solutions:

In the table with the sent solutions the judge system is going to show one of the following **possible results**:

* **Points count** (between 0 and 100), when the submitted code is compiled successfully (there are no syntax errors) and can be tested.
  - When the **solution is correct** all of the tests are marked in green and we receive **100 points**.
  - When the **solution is incorrect** some of the tests are marked in red and we receive incomplete or 0 points.
* When the program is incorrect we will receive **an error message** upon compiling.
