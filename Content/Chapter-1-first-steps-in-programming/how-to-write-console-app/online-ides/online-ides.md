### Online Development Environments

There are **alternative environments for development online** directly into your web browser. These environments are not very convinient, but if you don't have other opportunity, you can start your training with them and install Visual Studio later. Here are some useful links:

* For the language C# the site **.NET Fiddle** allows code writing and its execution online: [https://dotnetfiddle.net](https://dotnetfiddle.net).
* For Java you can use the following online Java IDE: [https://www.compilejava.net](https://www.compilejava.net).
* For JavaScript you can write a JS code directly in the console of a given browser when you press **[F12]**.
