## Development Environment (IDE)

As it has already been said, in order to program we need an **Integrated Development Environment** (IDE). This is actually an editor for programs, in which we write the program code and we can compile it and run it to see the errors, fix them and start the program again.

 - For programming with C# we use **Visual Studio** IDE for Windows operating system and **MonoDevelop** or **Raider** for Linux or Mac OS X.
 - If we program with Java, the environments **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Eclipse** or **NetBeans** are suitable.
 - If we write in Python, we can use the **PyCharm** environment.
