#### for loop Solution

**The solution** follows **the same** concept  (again we need to generate all combinations for the n element). Following these steps, try to solve the problem yourself.

-	Declare and initialize **variable** of type **`int`** and read the **input** from the console.
-	Nest **six `for` loops** one in each other,  for every single digit of the searched 6-digit numbers. 
-	In the last loop, using **`if`** construction check if the **product** of the six digits is **equal** to the **magic number**.
