#### Infinite while loop

Lets remove the **`if`** check from the innermost loop.   Now, let's initialize each variable outside of the loops and delete the rows **`dx = 0`**. After we run the program we only get 10 results.Why? What if you use **`do-while`**? In this case this loop does not look appropriate,doesn't it?Think why. Of course, you can solve the problem using **infinite loop**.

As we can see, we can solve a problem with different types of loops. Of course, each task has its most appropriate choice.In order to practice each loops - try to solve each of the following problems with all the learned loops.
