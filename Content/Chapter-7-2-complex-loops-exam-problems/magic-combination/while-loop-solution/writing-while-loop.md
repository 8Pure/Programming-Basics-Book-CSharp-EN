#### Writing while loop

Then we will start writing **`while`** loops.

- We will initialize **first digit**: **`d1 = 0`**.
- We will set a **condition for each** loop: the digit will be less than or equal to 9.
- In the **beginning** of every loop we set a value of the **next** digit, in this case: **`d2 = 0`**. In the nested **`for`** loops we initialize the variables in the inner loops at each increment of the outer ones.We want to do the same here.
- At **the end**  of each loop we will increase the digit by one : **`d++`**.
- In the **innermost** loop we will make **the check** and if necessary ,  we will print on the console.
