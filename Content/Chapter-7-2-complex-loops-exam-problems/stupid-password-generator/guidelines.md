### Hints and Guidelines

We can split the solution of the problem into 3 parts:

* **Read input** – in the current problem this includes reading two numbers **`n`** and **`l`**, each on a single line.
* **Processing input data** – using of nested loops to iterate through every possible symbol for each of the five password symbols.
* **Output** – printing every "dumb" password that meets the  requirements.
