# Chapter 7.2. More Complex Loops â€“ Exam Problems

We have already learned **how to execute** a block of commands **more than once** using a **for** loop. In the previous chapter **we reviewed some loop structures** that would help us solve more complex problems:

* **loops with a step**
* **nested** loops
* `while` loops
* `do-while` loop
* **infinite** loops and breaking out of loop \(`break` operator\)
* `try-catch` construction
