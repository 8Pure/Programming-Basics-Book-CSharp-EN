# Chapter 7.2.Complex loops - exam problems

We have already learned **how to execute a** block of commands **more than once** using a **for** loop. In the previous chapter **we reviewed some** **loop structures** that would help us solve more complex problems:

- **loops with step**

- **nested** loops

- **`while`** loops

- **`do-while`** loop

- **Infinite** loops and breaking out of loop (**`break`** operator)

- **`try-catch`** construction
