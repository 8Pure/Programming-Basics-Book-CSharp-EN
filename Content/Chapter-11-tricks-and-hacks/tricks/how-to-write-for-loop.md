### How to Write a 'for' Loop?

For a **`for` loop** we need a couple of things:

* Initializing block, in which the counting variable is declared (**`var i`**) and its initial value is set.
* Condition for repetition (**`i <= 10`**).
* Renewing the counter (**`i++`**).
* Body of the loop.

```csharp
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++;)
{
    // body
}
```

To make it easier we can use a code snippet for a **`for` loop**:
 * **`for` + [Tab] + [Tab]**
