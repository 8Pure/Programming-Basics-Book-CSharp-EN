### Naming Variables

In programming variables keep data and for the code to be more understandable the name of a variable should **suggest its purpose**. Here are some recommendations for naming variables:

* The name should be **short and descriptive** and to explain what the variable serves for.
* The name should only contain the letters **a-z**, **A-Z**, **the numbers 0-9**, and **the symbol '\_'**.
* It is accepted in C# for the variables to always **begin** **with a lowercase letter** and to **contain lowercase letters**, and **each next word** in them should **start with an uppercase letter** (this naming is also known as **`camelCase`** convention).
* You should be careful about uppercase and lowercase letters, because C# makes a difference between them. For example **`age`** and **`Age`** are different variables.
* The names of the variables can not coincide with keywords in the C# language, for example **`int`** is an invalid name for a variable.
