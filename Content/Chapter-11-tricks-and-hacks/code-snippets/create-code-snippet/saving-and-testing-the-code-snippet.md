#### Saving and Testing the Code Snippet

After we have written our snippet, we should **save the file in format** **`snippetName.snippet`** (in this case **`cr.snippet`**) and add it to Visual Studio. Go to [**Tools**] -> [**Code Snippet Manager**] -> [**Import**] and choose  the **`cr.snippet`** file that we have created:

![](/assets/chapter-11-images/01.Code-snippet-06.jpg) 

![](/assets/chapter-11-images/01.Code-snippet-08.jpg) 

Now when we write **`cr`** in Visual Studio, **our new snippet** appears:

![](/assets/chapter-11-images/01.Code-snippet-07.jpg)
