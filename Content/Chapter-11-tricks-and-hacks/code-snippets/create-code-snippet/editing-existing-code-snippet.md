#### Changing an Existing Snippet

Now we have to focus on the part **`<Title><Title>`**, **`<Shortcut><Shortcut>`** and the code between **`CDATA[]`**. Firstly, we will change the title in **`<Title><Title>`** and in place of **`cw`**we will write **`cr`**, as this will be **the title of our snippet**.

Finally, we need to change the code in **`CDATA[]`**, from **`WriteLine`** to **`ReadLine`**: **`CDATA[$SystemConsole$.ReadLine($end$);]`**. If you wish you can change the sections Description Ð¸ Author. The changed file should look like this:
