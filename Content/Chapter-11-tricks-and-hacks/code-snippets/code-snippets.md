## Code Snippets

In Visual Studio there are the so called **code snippets**, which write a block of code by being written. For example, by writing the short code “**`cw`**” and then pressing **[Tab]** + **[Tab]** the **`Console.WriteLine();`** code generates in the body of our program, in place of the short code.This is called “unfolding a code snippet”. The “**`for`**” + **[Tab]** + **[Tab]** snippet works in the same way. On the figure below you can see the “**`cw`**” snippet in action:
