# Visual Studio Shortcuts

In the previous section we mentioned two of the combinations, which are for formatting code. One of them [**CTRL + K + D**] was for **formatting the whole code in a file**, and the second [**CTRL + K + F**] serves if we want to **format just a piece of the code**. These combinations are called **shortcuts** and now we will give more thorough information for them.

Shortcuts are **combinations**, which give us the possibility to do some things **easier and faster**, and each IDE has its shortcuts, even though most of them are recurring. Now we will look at some of the **shortcuts** in **Visual Studio**.

| Combination | Action|
| --- | --- |
|  [**CTRL + F**] | The combination **opens the search window**, with which we can **search in our code**. |
|  [**CTRL + K + C**] | **Comments** part of the code. |
|  [**CTRL + K + U**] | **Uncomments a code**, which is already commented. |
|  [**CTRL + Z**] | **Brings back one change** (so called Undo). |
|  [**CTRL + Y**] | The combination is opposite of [**CTRL + Z**] (so called Redo). |
|  [**CTRL + K + D**] | **Formats the code** according the default conventions. |
|  [**CTRL + Backspace**] | **Deletes** the word in the left of the cursor. |
|  [**CTRL + Del**] | **Deletes** the word in the right of the cursor. |
|  [**CTRL + Shift + S**] | **Saves** all files in the project. |
|  [**CTRL + S**] | **Saves** the current file. |
