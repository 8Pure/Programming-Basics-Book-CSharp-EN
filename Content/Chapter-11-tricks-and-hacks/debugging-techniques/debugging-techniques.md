## Techniques for Debugging Our Code

Debugging plays an important role in the process of creating software, which is to allow us to **follow the implementation** of our program **step by step**. With this technique we can **follow the values of the local variables**, because they are changing during the execution of the program, and to **remove** eventual **errors** (bugs). The process of debugging includes:

* **Finding** the problems (bugs).
* **Locating** the code, which causes the problems.
* **Correcting** the code, which causes the problems, so that the program works correctly.
* **Testing** to make sure that the program works correctly after the corrections we have made.
