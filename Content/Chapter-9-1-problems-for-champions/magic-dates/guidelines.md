### Hints and Guidelines

We start with the input data. In this case, we have **3 integers** that should be read from the console, as this is the only entry and processing of input for the problem.

Having the start and the end year, it is nice to know how we will go through every date, not to worry about how many days there are in the month and whether it is a leap year, and so on.
