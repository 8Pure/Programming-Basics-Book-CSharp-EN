#### Reading the Input Data

As every problem, we start the solution with **reading and processing the input data**. In this case, we have **two integers** which can be processed with a combination of the **`int.Parse(â€¦)`** and **`Console.ReadLine()`** methods.

We have several main points in the problem - **generating all combinations** with a length of 5 including the 5 letters, **removing repeating letters** and **calculating weight** for a simplified word. The answer will consist of every word whose weight is within the given interval **`[firstNumber, secondNumber]`**.
