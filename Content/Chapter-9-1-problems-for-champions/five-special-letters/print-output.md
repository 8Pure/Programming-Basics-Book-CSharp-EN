#### Final Touches

The condition is met **unless we do not have a single word in the entered interval**. In order to find out if we have found a word, we can simply check whether the string **`result`** has its initial value (i.e., an empty string), if it does, we print **`No`**, otherwise we print the whole string without the last interval (using the **`.Trim ()`**) method.
