#### Generate Tribonacci Sequence

For the Tribonacci sequence we will always **collect the previous three values** and then move the values of those numbers (the three previous ones) one position in the sequence, ie. the value of the first one must accept the value of the second one, and so on. When we are done with the number, we will keep its value in **an array**. Since the problem description states that the numbers in the ranks do not exceed 1,000,000, we can stop generating this range at exactly 1,000,000.
