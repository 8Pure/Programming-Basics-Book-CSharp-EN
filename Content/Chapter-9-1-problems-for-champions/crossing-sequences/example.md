### Example

Let **the Tribonacci sequence** start with **1**, **2** and **3**. This means that **the first sequence** will contain the numbers 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 20, 37, 68, 125, 230, 423, 778, 1431, 2632, 4841, 8904, 16377, 30122, 55403 , 101902, and so on.

At the same time, let the **numbers in the spiral** begin with **5** and the spiral increases by **2** at each step.

Then **the second sequence** will contain the numbers 5, 7, 9, 13, 17, 23, 29, 37 and so on. We see that **37** is the first number to be found in the Tribonacci sequence and in the spiral one, and that is the desired solution to the problem.
