#### Printing the Base of the Fort

In order to draw the second to last row, which is a part of the base, we need to print a beginning **`|`**, middle **`(white space)_(white space)`** and an end **`|`**. In order to do this we can use the already declared variables **`colSize`** and **`midSize`** again, because we can see from the exmaples that they are equal to the **`_`** in the roof.

We add **`+ 1`** to the **white spaces** , because we have **one** white space more in the examples.

The structure of **the base of the fort** is the same as the one of **the roof**. It is made up of **two towers** and **a middle part**. Each **tower** begins with **`\`**, then a middle **`_`** and an end **`/`**.
