#### Printing the Lower Part of the Axe

We need to divide **the lower part** of the figure into two subparts - **head of the axe** and **the last row of the figure**. We will print **the head of the axe** on the console by making a loop which recurs **`n / 2 - 1`** times. At each iteration **the left dashes** and **the right dashes** decrease by 1, and **the middle dashes** increase by 2.

For **the last row** we can use the three declared and initialized varibles **`leftDashes`**, **`middleDashes`**, **`rightDashes`** again.
