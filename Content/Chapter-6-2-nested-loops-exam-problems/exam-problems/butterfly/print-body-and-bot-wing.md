#### Printing the Body and the Lower Wing 

In order to make **the body of the butterfly** we can use **the variable** **`halfRowSize`** again and print in the console exactly **one** row. The body structure begins with **`(white space)`**, middle **`@`** and ends with **`(white space)`**.

Now we need to print the lower wing, which is the same as the upper.
