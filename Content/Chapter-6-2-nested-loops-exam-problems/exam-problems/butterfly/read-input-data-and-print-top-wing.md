#### Reading the Input Data and Printing the Upper Wing

We can see in the explanation that **the input data** will be taken from only one row which contains **an integer** in the interval [**3 â€¦ 1000**]. This is why we will use **a variable** of type **`int`**.

We can divide the figure into 3 parts - upper wing, body and lower wing. In order to draw the upper wing, we need to divide it into parts - beginning **`*`**, middle **`\ /`** and end **`*`**. After looking at the examples we find that the beginning is with size **`n - 2`**.

We can also see that the upper wing is with size **`n - 2`**, and that's why we can make a loop which recurs **`halfRowSize`** times.

We can see in the examples that on an even row we have a beginning **`*`**, a middle **`\ /`** and an end **`*`**, and on an odd row - beginning **`-`**, middle **`\ /`** and an end **`-`**. This is why we must make an **`if-else`** to check if the row is even or odd and then to draw one of the two types of rows.
