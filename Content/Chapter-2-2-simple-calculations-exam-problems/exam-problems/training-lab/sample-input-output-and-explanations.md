#### Clarification of the examples:

In the first example, the hall length is 1500 cm. **12 rows** can be situated in it (12 * 120 cm = 1440 + 60 cm difference). The hall width is 890 cm. 100 cm of them are for the hallway in the middle. The rest 790 cm can be situated by **11 desks per row** (11 * 70 cm = 770 cm + 20 cm difference). **Number of places = 12 * 11 - 3** = 132 - 3 = **129** (we have 12 rows with 11 working places = 132 minus 3 places for podium and entrance door).

In the second example, the hall length is 840 cm. **7 rows** can be situated in it (7 * 120 cm = 840, no difference). The hall width is 520 cm. 100 cm from them are for the hallway in the middle. The rest 420 cm can be situated by **6 desks per row** (6 * 70 cm = 420 cm, no difference). **Number of places = 7 * 6 - 3** = 42 - 3 = **39** (we have 7 rows with 6 working places = 42 minus 3 places for podium and entrance door).
