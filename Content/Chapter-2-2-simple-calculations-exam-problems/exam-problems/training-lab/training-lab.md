## Problem: Training Lab

**A training lab** has a rectangular size **l** to **w** meters, without columns on the inside. The hall is divided in two parts- left and right, with a hallway approximately in the middle. In both of the parts, there are **rows with desks**. In the back of the hall, there is a big **entrance door** and in the front, there is a **podium** for the lecturer. A single **working place** takes up **70 to 120 cm** (a table with size 70 to 40 cm + space for a chair with size 70 to 80 cm). **The hallway** width is at least **100 cm**. It is calculated that due to the **entrance door** (which is with 160 cm opening), **exactly one working space is lost**, and due to the **podium** (which is with size 160 to 120 cm), exactly **two working spaces** are lost. Write a program that receives the size of the training lab as input parameters and calculates the **number of working places in it **(look at the figure).

### Input Data

**Two numbers** are read from the console, one per line: **l** (length in meters) and **w** (width in meters).

Constraints: **3 ≤ w ≤ l ≤ 100.**

### Output Data

Print an integer: the **number of working places** in the training lab.
