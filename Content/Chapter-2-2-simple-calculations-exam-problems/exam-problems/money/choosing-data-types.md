#### Choosing Data Types

**Bitcoins** are given as **an integer**, therefore, we can declare a **variable of `int`** type for their value. For **Chinese yuan and commission fee** we receive **a floating-point number**, therefore, we are going to use **`double`**. As **`double`** is the data type with bigger scope, and the **output** should also be **a floating-point number**, we will use it for the other variables we create as well.
