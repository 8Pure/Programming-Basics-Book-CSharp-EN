#### Printing the Result

Finally, we have to print the result on the console. We notice that **the number has to be rounded up to the second symbol after the decimal point**. In order to do that, we can use a **placeholder - an item that will be replaced by a particular value when printing**. In C#, a digit surrounded by curly brackets is used for a **placeholder**. As **in programming counting starts from 0**, the expression **`{0}`** means that it will be replaced by the first given argument. We can format an integer or a floating-point number by using **F** or **f**. That is followed by a whole positive number, which specifies the number of digits after the point (you can read more about formatting here: ([Svetlin Nakov, Veselin Kolev and team: "Programming Basics with C#", page. 155-158](http://www.introprogramming.info/intro-csharp-book/read-online/glava4-vhod-i-izhod-ot-konzolata/#_Toc298863992)):
