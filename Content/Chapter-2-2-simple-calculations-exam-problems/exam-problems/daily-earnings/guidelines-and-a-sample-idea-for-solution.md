#### Idea for Solution

Let' s first calculate **how much the monthly salary** of Ivan is. We do that by **multiplying the working days per month by his daily earnings**. Firstly, we multiply the number by 12, so as to calculate his salary for 12 months, and then, we multiply it **by 2.5 ** in order to calculate the bonus. After having summed the two values, we calculate his **annual income**. Then, we **divide 25% of it**. We can do that by multiplying the total income by **0.25** and divide the result by it. Depending on the exchange rate, we **exchange the dollars to levs** and after that we **divide the result by 365 (days per year)**.
