#### Choosing Data Types

**The working days** per month are given as **an integer**, therefore, we can declare a variable of **`int` type** to store their value. For both **the earned money** and **the exchange rate of dollar to lev**, we will receive **a floating-point number**, therefore, we will use **`double`**. As **`double`** is the data type with **the higher scope**, and the output should also be **a floating-point number**, we use **`double`** for the other variables that we create as well.
