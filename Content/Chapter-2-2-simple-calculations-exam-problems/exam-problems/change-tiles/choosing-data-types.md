#### Choosing Data Types

The length of the side of the ground, the width and the length of the bench, will be given as **integers**, therefore, in order to store their values, we can declare **variables of `int`** type. We will be given floating-point numbers for the width and the length of the tiles and this is why we will use **`double`**. The output will be a floating-point number as well, so the variables will be of **`double`** type as well.
