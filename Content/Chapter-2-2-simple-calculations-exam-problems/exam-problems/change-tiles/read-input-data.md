#### Reading the Input Data

As in the previous tasks, we can divide the solution into three smaller tasks:
* **Reading the input from the console**.
* **Doing the calculations**.
* **Printing the output** on the console.

The first thing we have to do, is go through **the input** of the task. It is important to pay attention the the sequence they are given in. With **`Console.ReadLine(…)`** we read values from the console and with **`int.Parse(…)`** and **`double.Parse(…)`**, we convert the particular string value into **`int`** or **`double`**.
