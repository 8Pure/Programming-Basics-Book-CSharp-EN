### Example: a point on the border of a rectangle

Write a program that checks whether a **point {x, y}** is placed **onto any of the sides of the rectangle {x1, y1} - {x2, y2}**. The input data is read from the console and  it consists of 6 rows: the decimal numbers **x1**, **y1**, **x2**, **y2**, **x** and **y** (as it is garanteed that **x1 < x2** and **y1 < y2**). Print "**Border**" (if the point lies on any of the sides) or "**Inside / Outside**" (in the opposite case).
