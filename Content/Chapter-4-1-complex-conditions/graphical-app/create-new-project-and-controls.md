#### Create a new C# project and add controls
 
We create a new project **Windows Forms Application** with a suitable name, for example “Point-and-Rectangle”:

**We arrange the controls** inside the form, as it is shown in the figure below:

 * 6 boxes for entering a number (**`NumericUpDown`**).
 * Labels (**`Label`**) before every box number box.
 * A button (**`Button`**) for drawing the rectangle and the point. 
 * A text block for the result (**`Label`**).

We set the **sizes** and **properties** of the controls to look as closely as the ones in the picture:
