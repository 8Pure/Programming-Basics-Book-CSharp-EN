#### Compile and test the application

In the end we **compile the code**. If there are errors, we eliminate them. The most probable **reason** for an error is **an inconsistent name of some of the controls** or if **you wrote the code in the wrong place**.

**We start the application** and **test** it. We enter different data to see whether it behaves correctly.

If you have problems with the sample project above, **watch the video** in the begining of this chapter. There the application is built live step by step with a lot of explanations. Or ask in the **forum of SoftUni**: https://softuni.bg/forum.
