### Problem: * Point and Triangle â€“ Graphical (GUI) Application

The task that we have is to develop a graphical (**GUI**) application for **visualizing a point and a rectangle**. The application must look like identically to the following:

![](/assets/chapter-4-images/14.Point-in-rectangle-gui-02.png)

![](/assets/chapter-4-images/14.Point-in-rectangle-gui-03.png)

Using the controls on the left we set the coordinates of **two of the angles of the rectangle** (decimal numbers) and the coordinates of the **point**. The application **visualizes graphically** the rectangle and the point and prints whether the point is **inside** the rectangle (**Inside**), **outside** of it (**Outside**) or on one of its sides (**Border**).
The application **moves and resizes** the coordinates of the rectangle and the point to be maximum large, but to fit the field for visualization in the right side of the application.

<td>Attention: this application is significantly <b>more complex</b> than the previous graphical applications, which we have developed unitl now, because it requires using functions for drawing and non-trivial calculations for resizing and moving the rectangle and the point. Instructions for building the application step by step follow.</td>
