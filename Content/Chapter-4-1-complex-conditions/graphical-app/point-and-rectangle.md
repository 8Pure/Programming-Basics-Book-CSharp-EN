### Problem: * a point in a rectangle â€“ graphical (GUI) application

The task, which we are giving ourselves is to develop a graphical (**GUI**) application for **visualizing a point and a rectangle**. The application must look like as similar as the following:

From the controls on the left are set the coordinates of **two of the angles of the rectangle** (decimal numbers) and the coordinates of the **point**. The application **visualizes graphically** the rectangle and the point and prints whether the point is **inside** the rectangle (**Inside**), **outside** of it (**Outside**) or on one of its sides (**Border**).
The application **moves and resizes** the coordinates of the rectangle and the point to be maximally big, but to fit the field for visualization in the right side of the application.

<td>Attention: this application is significantly <b>more complex</b> than the previous graphical applications, which we have developed unitl now, because it requires using functions for drawing and nontrivial calculations for resizing and moving the rectangle and the point. Instructions for building the application step by step  follow.</td>
