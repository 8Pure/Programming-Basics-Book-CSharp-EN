### The Parenthesis `()` Operator

Like the rest of the operators in programming, the operators **`&&`** and **`||`** have a priority, as in the case **`&&`** is with higher priority than **`||`**. The operator **`()`** serves for **changing the priority of operators** and is being calculated first, just like in mathematics. Using parentheses also gives the code better readability and is considered a good practice.
