### Problem: Cinema

In a cinema hall the chairs are ordered in a **rectangle** shape in **r** rows and **c** columns. There are three types of screenings with tickets of **different** prices:

* **Premiere** – a premiere screening, with price **12.00** levs.
* **Normal** – a standard screening, with price **7.50** levs.
* **Discount** – a screening for children and students on a reduced price - **5.00** levs.

Write a program that enters a **type of screening** (string), number of **rows** and number of **columns** in the hall (integer numbers) and calculates **the total income** from tickets from a **full hall**. The result has to be printed in the same format as in the examples below - rounded up to 2 digits after the decimal point.
