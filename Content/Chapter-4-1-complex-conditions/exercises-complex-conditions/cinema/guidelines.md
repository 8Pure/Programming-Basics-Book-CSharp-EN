#### Hints and Guidelines 

While reading the input, we could convert the type of the projcection into small letters (with the function **`.ToLower()`**). We create and initialize a varibale, which will store the calculated income. In another variable we calculate the full capacity of the hall. We use a **`switch-case`** conditional statement to calculate the income according to the type of the projection and we print the result on the console in the given format. (look for the needed **C#** functionality on the internet). 

Sample code (parts of the code are blurred with the purpose of stimulating the thinking and solving skills):
