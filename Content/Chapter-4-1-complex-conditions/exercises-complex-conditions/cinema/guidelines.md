#### Tips and Tricks

While reading the input, we could convert the screening type into small letters (with the function **`.ToLower()`**). We create and initialize a variable that will store the calculated income. In another variable we calculate the full capacity of the hall. We use a **`switch-case`** conditional statement to calculate the income according to the type of the projection and print the result on the console in the given format (look for the needed **C#** functionality on the internet). 

Sample code (parts of the code are blurred with the purpose to stimulate your thinking and solving skills):
