#### Hints and Guidelines

A possible logic for solving the task (not the only correct one):

* We might split the figure into **two rectangles** with a common side:

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/chapter-4-images/13.Point-in-the-figure-03.png" /></p>

* A point is **outer (outside)** for the figure, when it is **outside** both of the rectangles.
* A point is **inner (inside)** for the figure, if it is inside some of the rectangles (excluding their borders) or lies on their common side.
* In **other case** the point lies on the border of the rectangle (**border**).
