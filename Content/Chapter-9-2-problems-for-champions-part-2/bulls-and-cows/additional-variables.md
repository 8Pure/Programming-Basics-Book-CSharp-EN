#### Creating Additional Variables

Only two last steps remain until we start analyzing how many cows and bulls there are in a particular number. Accordingly, the first one is the **declaration of `counter` variables** in the nested loops, in order to **count the cows and bulls** for the current number. The second step is to make **copies of the digits of the current number** that we will analyze, in order to prevent problems upon working with nested loops, in case we make changes to them.

We are ready to start analyzing the generated numbers.
