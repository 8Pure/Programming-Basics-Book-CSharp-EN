#### Formatting the Output

In the end of our task we must **print** a particular **output**, depending on the following condition:

> - If no purchases have been made â€“ "**No purchases. Money left: {remaining funds} lv.**"
> - If at least one purchase is made - "**{number of purchases} purchases. Money left: {remaining funds} lv.**"

The printing operations are trivial, as the only thing we need to take into consideration is that **the amount has to be printed with accuracy of up to 2 symbols after the decimal point**.

How can we do that? We will leave the answer to this question to the reader.
