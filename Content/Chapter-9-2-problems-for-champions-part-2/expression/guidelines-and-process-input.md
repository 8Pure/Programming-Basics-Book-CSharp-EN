### Tips and Tricks

As usual, we will first read and process the input, after that we will solve the problem, and finally, we will print the result, formatted as required.

#### Reading the Input Data

The input data will consist of exactly one row read from the console. Here we have **two ways** to process the input. The first way is by **reading the entire row using the `Console.ReadLine()` command** and accessing each symbol (**`char`**) of the row via a **`foreach` loop**. The second one is by **reading the input symbol by symbol using the `Console.Read()` command** and processing each symbol.

We will use the second option to solve the problem.
