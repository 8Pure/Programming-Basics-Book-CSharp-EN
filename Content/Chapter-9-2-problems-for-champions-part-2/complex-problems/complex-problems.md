## More Complex Problems on the Studied Material

Before we move on to particular tasks, we must clarify that these can be solved in an easier way with **additional knowledge in programming with C#** (methods, arrays, collections, recursion, etc.), but each solution that will be provided now only uses the material covered in this book. The goal is to learn how to construct **more complex algorithms** based on your knowledge collected up to the present moment.
