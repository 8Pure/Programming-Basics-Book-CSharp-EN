# About the Software University \(SoftUni\)

[The Software University \(SoftUni\)](http://softuni.bg) is **the largest training center for software engineers in the South-Eastern Europe**. Tens of thousands of students pass through the university every year. SoftUni was founded in 2014, as a continuation of the hard work of [**Dr. Svetlin Nakov**](http://nakov.com) in building **skilled software professionals** by a real, contemporary and quality education, that combines fundamental knowledge with modern software technologies and a lot of practice.

The Software University provides **quality education**, **profession**, **job** and **the opportunity to acquire Bachelor's degree** for programmers, software engineers and IT professionals. SoftUni builds an extremely successful and strong **connection between education and industry** by collaboration with hundreds of software companies, provides job and internship of its students, creates quality professionals for the software industry and directly responds to the needs of employers via the training process.

## Free Programming Courses at SoftUni

SoftUni organizes **free programming lessons for beginners** all across Bulgaria. You can choose between on-site and online training. The purpose is to give a chance to **everyone who is interested** in programming and technologies to **try programming**, and check if they are interested and if they would get seriously involved in software development. You can sign up for the free course in **programming basics** using the SoftUni application page: [http://softuni.bg/apply](http://softuni.bg/apply).

The free courses at SoftUni have the purpose to introduce you to **basic programming constructions** in the software development world, that you can use at any programming language. These include working with **data**, **variables** and **expressions**, using **conditional statements**, constructing **loops**, defining and calling **methods** and other approaches for building programming logic. The trainings are **highly practically oriented** which means that **the emphasis is strongly on exercises**, and you get the opportunity to apply your knowledge during the learning process.

This **programming book** accompanies the free programming lessons for beginners in SoftUni and serves as an additional teaching aid to help the learning process.

## About the Automated Judge System

**The SoftUni Judge system** \([http://judge.softuni.bg](http://judge.softuni.bg)\) is an automated Internet system for **verifying the solutions of programming exercises via series of tests**. The submission and verification happens in **real time**: you submit the solution and  within seconds you receive an answer whether it is correct. Each **successfully** taken test gives you the points it gains. For a correct solution you get all the points for the particular task. For partially correct solution you get part of the points for the task. For a completely wrong solution you get 0 points.

**All tasks from the current book are available for testing in SoftUni judge** and we strongly recommend to test them after you solve them to be sure you don't miss anything and that your solution works correctly according to the task requirements.

Keep in mind some **specifics about SoftUni judge**:

* For each task the **judge system keeps the best score you had**. Therefore if you upload a solution with wrong code or lower score compared to the previous one, the system won't take away your points.
* The output of your program is **compared** by the system to a strictly expected result. Every **unnecessary symbol, missing comma or interval** may lead to 0 points on a particular test. The **output** that the judge expects is **described in the requirements of every task** and **nothing else should be added**. 
* **Example:** If the output requires to print a number \(ex. `25`\), do not display any descriptive mess–∞ges such as `The result is: 25`, just print as it is required, i.e. only the number.

  The SoftUni judge system is **available any time** via its website: [https://judge.softuni.bg](https://judge.softuni.bg).

  * To sign in use your authentication for the SoftUni website: [https://softuni.org](https://softuni.org).
  * Using the softuni system is **free** and it's not bound with the participation in SoftUni's courses.

We are convinced that after sending a few tasks **you will like receiving instant feedback** for your solutions and the Judge system will become your favorite helper in your programming practice.
