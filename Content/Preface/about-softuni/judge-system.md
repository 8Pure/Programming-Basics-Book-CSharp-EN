### About the Judge System 

**The SoftUni Judge system** (http://judge.softuni.bg) is an automated Internet system for **verifying the solutions of programming exercises via series of tests**. The submission and verification happens in **real time**: you submit the solution and  within seconds you receive an answer whether it is correct. Each **successfully** taken test gives you the points it gains. For a correct solution you get all the points for the particular task. For partially correct solution you get part of the points for the task. For a completely wrong solution you get 0 points. 

**All tasks from the current book are available for testing in SoftUni judge** and we strongly recommend to test them after you solve them to be sure you don't miss anything and that your solution works correctly according to the task requirements. 

Keep in mind some **specifics about SoftUni judge**
 - For each task the **judge system keeps the best score you had**. Therefore if you upload a solution with wrong code or lower score compared to the previous one, the system won't take away your points.
 - The output of your program is **compared** by the system to a strictly expected result. Every **unnecessary symbol, missing comma or interval** may lead to 0 points on a particular test. The **output** that the judge expects is **described in the requirements of every task** and **nothing else should be added**. 
 - 
 **Example:** If the output requires to print a number (ex. `25`), do not display any descriptive mess–∞ges such as `The result is: 25`, just print as it is required, i.e. only the number. 

 The SoftUni judge system is **available any time** via its website: [https://judge.softuni.bg](https://judge.softuni.bg).
  - To sign in use your authentication for the SoftUni website: [https://softuni.bg](https://softuni.bg).
  - Using the softuni system is **free** and it's not bound with the participation in SoftUni's courses.

We are convinced that after sending a few tasks **you will like receiving instant feedback** for your solutions and the Judge system will become your favorite helper in your programming practice.
