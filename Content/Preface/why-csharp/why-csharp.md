## Why Did We Choose C#?

For this book, we choose the **C#** language because it is a **modern language** for high-level programming, open source, easy to learn and **suitable for beginners**. Using C# is **widespread**, with a well-developed ecosystem, numerous libraries and technology frameworks, and accordingly, it gives many **perspectives** for development. C# combines paradigms of procedural, object-oriented and functional programming in a modern way with easy syntax. In this book, we will use **C#** language and **Visual Studio** development environment, which are available for free from Microsoft.

 
As we will explain later, **the programming language that we start with, does not make a significant difference**, but we still need to use some programming language, and in this book we choose C# specifically. The book can also be found mirrored in other programming languages such as Java and JavaScript (see https://csharp-book.softuni.bg).
