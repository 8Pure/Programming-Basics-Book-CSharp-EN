## Why did we choose C #?

For this book, we choose **C #** language because it is a **modern language** for high-level open source programming, easy to learn and **appropriate for beginners**. Using C # is **widespread**, with a well-developed ecosystem, with many libraries and technology frameworks and accordingly gives many **prospects** for development. C # combines paradigms of procedural, object-oriented and functional programming in a modern way with easy syntax. In this book, we will use **C #** and **Visual Studio** development environment, which are available for free from Microsoft.

 
As we will explain later, **the programming language which we start does not matter** but we still need to use some programming language, and in this book we choose C #. The book can also be found mirrored in other programming languages such as Java and JavaScript
