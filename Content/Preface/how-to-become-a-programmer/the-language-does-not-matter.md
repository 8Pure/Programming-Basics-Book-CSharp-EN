### Programming Language Doesn't Matter!

As it already became clear, **the difference between programming languages** and more specifically between the skills of developers in different languages and technologies forms around **10-20% of the skills**.

* All programmers have around **80-90% of the same skills** that do not depend on the language! These are the skills to program and develop software, that are very similar in different programming languages and development technologies.
* The more languages and technologies you know, the faster you will learn new ones, and the less you will feel the difference between them.

Indeed, **the programming language almost does not matter**, you just have to learn to program, and this starts with **coding** (this book) goes on in the more complex **programming concepts** (like data structures, algorithms, OOP and FP) and includes the use of **fundamental knowledge and skills for software development, software engineering and computer science**.

Only when you start working with a specific technology into a software project you will need **a specific programming language**, knowledge in particular programming libraries (APIs), frameworks and software technologies (front-end UI technologies, back-end technologies, ORM technologies, etc.). Keep calm, you will learn them, all programmers are learning them, but first you need to learn the foundation: **to program and do it well**.

This book uses the C# language, but it is not required and can be replaced with Java, JavaScript, Python, PHP, C ++, Ruby, Swift, Go, Kotlin, or any other language. To be a **software developer**, you need to learn **coding** (20%), learn to **think algorithmically**, and **solve problems** (30%), to have **fundamental knowledge of programming and computer science** (25%) and to master a **specific programming language and the technologies around it** (25%). Be patient, for a year or two all this can be mastered on a good starting level, as long as you are serious.
