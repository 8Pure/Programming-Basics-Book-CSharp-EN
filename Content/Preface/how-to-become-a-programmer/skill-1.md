### Skill #1 - Coding (20%)

**Writing code** forms around 20% of the minimum knowledge and skills of a programmer, needed for starting a job in a software company. The skill of coding includes the following components:
* Working with variables, conditional statements, loops
* Using functions, methods, classes and objects
* Data manipulation: arrays, lists, hash tables, strings

The skill of coding **can be acquired in a few months** of hard learning and solving practical problems by writing code every day. This book covers only the first point of coding: **working with variables, conditional statements and loops**. The rest remains to be learned in follow-up trainings, courses and books.

The book (and the courses based on it) gives only the beginning of one long and serious training on the way to professional programming. If you don't learn perfectly the material from this book, you can't become a programmer. You are going to miss fundamentals and it will be harder in the future. For this reason, **give enough time to programming basics**: solve many problems and write code every day for months until you learn to **solve every problem from the book very easily**. Then go ahead.

We specifically note that **the programming language does not matter** for the ability to code. You can code or not. If you can code with C#, you will easily learn to code with Java, C++ or other languages. That's why **the coding skills** are being studied quite seriously at the beginners courses in SoftUni ([curriculum](https://softuni.bg/curriculum)), and each programming book for beginners starts with them, including this one.
