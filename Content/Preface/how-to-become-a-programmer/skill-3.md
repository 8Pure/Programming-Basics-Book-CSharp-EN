### Skill # 3 - Fundamental Understanding of the Profession (25%)

**Fundamental knowledge and skills** for programming, software development, software engineering and computer science form around 25% of the developer's minimum skills to start a job. Here are the more important of these skills and knowledge:

* **basic mathematical concepts** related to programming: coordinate systems, vectors and matrices, discrete and non-discrete mathematical functions, state automats and state machines, combinatorics and statistics concepts, algorithm complexity, mathematical modeling and others
* **programming skills** - code writing, working with data, using conditional statements and loops, working with arrays, lists and associative arrays, strings and text processing, working with streams and files, using programming interfaces (APIs), working with debugger, etc.
* **data structures and algorithms** - lists, trees, hash-tables, graphs, search, sorting, recursion, binary search trees, etc.
* **object-oriented programming** (OOP) - working with classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, interfaces, data encapsulation, exceptions management, design pattern
* **functional programming** (FP) - working with lambda functions, higher order functions, functions that return a function as a result, closure, etc.
* **databases** - relational and non-relational databases, database modeling (tables and links between them), SQL query language, object-relational mapping (ORM), transactions and transaction management
* **network programming** - network protocols, network communication, TCP/IP, concepts, tools and technologies from computer networks
* **client-server** interaction, peer to peer communication, back-end technologies, front-end technologies, MVC architectures
* **technology for server (back-end) development** - web server architecture, HTTP protocol, MVC architecture, REST architecture, web development frameworks, templating engines
* **web front-end technologies (client development)** - HTML, CSS, JS, HTTP, DOM, AJAX, communication with back-end, calling REST API, front-end frameworks, basic design and UX (user experience) concepts
* **mobile technologies** - mobile apps, Android and iOS development, mobile user interface (UI), calling server logic 
* **embedded systems** - microcontrollers, digital and analog input and output control, sensor access, peripheral management
* **operating systems** - working with operating systems (Linux, Windows, etc.), installation, configuration and basic system administration, process management, memory, file system, users, multitasking, virtualization and containers
* **parallel programming and asynchrony** - thread management, asynchronous tasks, promises, common resources, and access synchronization
* **software engineering** - source control systems, development management, task planning and management, software development methodologies, software requirements and prototypes, software design, software architectures, software documentation
* **software testing** - unit testing, test-driven development, QA engineering, error reporting and error tracking, automation testing, build processes and continuous integration

We need to clarify once again that **the programming language does not matter** for the assimilation of all these skills. They accumulate slowly, over many years of practice in the profession. Some knowledge is fundamental and can be learned theoretically, but for their full understanding and in-depth awareness, you need years of practice.

Fundamental knowledge and skills for programming, software development, software engineering, and computer science are taught during the **[Software Engineer Program](https://softuni.bg/curriculum)**, as well as a number of [optional courses](https://softuni.bg/trainings/opencourses). Working with a variety of software libraries, APIs, frameworks and software technologies and their interaction gradually builds this knowledge and skills, so do not expect that you will understand them from a single course, book or project.

To start working as a programmer, only **basic knowledge in the areas listed above** is enough and the improvement happens at the workplace according to the technology and development tools used in the company and the team.
