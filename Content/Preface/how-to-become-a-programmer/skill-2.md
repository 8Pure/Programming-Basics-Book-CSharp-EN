### Skill #2 Algorithmic Thinking (30%)

The algorithmic (logical, engineering, mathematical, abstract) thinking forms around 30% of the minimum skills of a programmer needed to start the profession. **Algorithmic thinking** is the ability to break a particular problem into a logical sequence (algorithm), to find a solution for every separate step and then assemble the steps into a working solution. That is the most important skill of any programmer.

How to **build algorithmic thinking**?
* Algorithmic thinking is developed by solving **multiple  programming (1000+) problems**, as diverse as possible. That is the recipe: solving thousands of practical problems, building algorithms and implementing the algorithms, along with debugging the issues that come up in the process. 
* Sciences like physics, mathematics and identical ones helps a lot, but they are not mandatory! People with **engineering and technical skills** usually learn very easily to think logically, because they already **have the problem solving skill**, even if it is not algorithmic.
* The ability of **solving programming problems** (for which algorithmic thinking is needed) is extremely important for a programmer. Many companies test particularly this skill during their jobs interviews.

The current book develops the **beginner level of algorithmic thinking**, but it's not enough to make you a good programmer. To become good at this profession you have to add **logical thinking and problem solving skills**, beyond the range of this book. For example, working with **data structures** (arrays, lists, matrices, hash-tables, binary trees) and basic **algorithms** (searching, sorting, searching in tree structures, recursion, etc.).

**Algorithmic thinking skill** can be seriously developed at the beginner courses for software engineers in SoftUni (see [curriculum](https://softuni.bg/curriculum)) as well as in specialized algorithmic courses [data structures](https://softuni.bg/opencourses/data-structures) and [algorightms](https://softuni.bg/opencourses/algorithms).

As you can guess **the programming language doesn't matter** for the development of algorithmic thinking. To think logically is a universal skill, and it's not related only to programming. Because of the well developed logical thinking it's believed that programmers are smart people, and that a stupid person can't become a programmer.
