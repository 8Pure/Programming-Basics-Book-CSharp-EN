## The Story of This Book

General head of the project to create the book **free programming book for begginers** with an open-source code is **[Dr. Svetlin Nakov](http://www.nakov.com)**. He is the main ideologist and founder of the learning content of the **[course "Programming Basics" in SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/courses/programming-basics)**, which was used as the basis of the book. 

Everything begins with the massive amount of **free basic programming lessons**, conducted in the whole country started in 2014 till now, when the "SoftUni" initiative launched. At the beggining these lessons had large range of theory, but in 2016 Dr. Svetlin Nakov completely revise, update and simplifies the whole method of teaching, strongly emphasizes on practice. That is how the core of the **learning contect is created**.

The free lessons at SoftUni for a start at programming, maybe are the most extensive ones ever conducted in Bulgaria. Until 2017 the course programming basics **is being held over 150 times, in around 40 bulgarian towns** in person and multiple times online with 50 000 participants in. Absolutely natural was the need to be written a **book** for the tens of thousands participants at SoftUni basic programming course. On the principle of free software and free knowledge, Svetlin Nakov leads a team of volunteers and starts that open-source project. At first the idea is to create a book with the basis of C# programming language and then other books with other programming languages.

The book was initially written in **Bulgarian language** and later translated into **English**.

The project is part of the hard work of **[Software University fondation](http://softuni.foundation)** to create and distribute an open learning content to teach software engineers and IT profesionals.
