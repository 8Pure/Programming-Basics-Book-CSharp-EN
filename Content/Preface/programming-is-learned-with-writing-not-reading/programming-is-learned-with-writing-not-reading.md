## Programming Is Learned by a Lot of Writing, Not Reading!

If someone thinks they will read a book and learn to program without writing code and solving problems, this is definitely a delusion. Programming needs **a lots of practice**, with code writing every day and solving hundreds, even thousands of problems, seriously and persistently for years.

You need **to solve а lot of problems**, to make mistakes, to fix, to search for solutions and information from the Internet, to try, to experiment, to find better solutions, to get used to the code, syntax, the programming language, the development environment, to search for errors and debugging the broken code, the algorithmic thinking, breaking the problems into smaller parts, gaining experience and raising your skills every day, because when you learn to write code, this is only the **first step to the profession of the "software engineer"**. You have a lot to learn, really!

We advise the reader, as a minimum, **to try out all the examples from the book**, to play with them, to change them and test them. Even more important than the examples are **the exercises** because they develop the programmer's practical skills.

**You need to solve all the problems in the book** because programming is learned with practice! The exercises after each topic are carefully selected to cover in depth the learning material. Тhe purpose of solving all the problems is to provide **complete set of skills for writing programming code** at a beginners level (which is the purpose of this book). During the courses in SoftUni we purposefully **focus on practice** and problem solving, and in most courses code writing occupies over 70% of the entire course.
