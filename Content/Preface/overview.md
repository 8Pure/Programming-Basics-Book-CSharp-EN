It introduce readers with writing **programming code** at a beginners level (basic coding skills), working with **development environment** (IDE), using **variables** and data, **operators** and **expressions** , working with **console** (reading input data and printing output), using **conditional statements** (**`if`**, **`if-else`** , **`switch-case`**), **loops** (**`for`**, **`while`** ,**`do-while`**, **`foreach`**) and **methods** (declaring and calling methods, passing parameters, and returning value).
