#### Helper Variable

We initially **store** one **variable** that will be used multiple times. This centralization approach gives us **flexibility** and **possibility** to **modify** the end result of the program with minimum efforts. In case we need to change the value, we must do it in **only once place in the code**, which saves us time and effort.

<td><strong>Avoiding repetitive code</strong> (centralization of the program logic) in the tasks that we examine in the present book may look unnecessary at first glance, but this approach is very important upon building large applications in a real work environment, and its exercising in an initial stage of training will help you build a quality programming style.
