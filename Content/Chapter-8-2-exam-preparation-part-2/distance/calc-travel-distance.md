#### Calculating Travel Distance

We calculate the **travel time** (in hours) by **dividing the time by 60** (minutes in an hour). The **travel distance** is calculated by **multiplying the starting speed by the time passed** (in hours). After that we change the speed by increasing it by **10%**, as per the task description. Calculating the **percentage**, as well as the following **distances** passed, is done in the following way:

* **The time frame** (in hours) is calculated by **dividing** the provided time frame in minutes by the minutes that are contained in an hour (60).
* **The distance passed** is calculated by **multiplying** the time frame (in hours) by the speed that is received after the increase.
* The next step is to **decrease the speed** by **5%**, as per the problem description.
* We calculate the **remaining distance** in the manner described in the first two points.
