### Tips and Tricks

It is possible that such a description may look **misleading** and incomplete at first glance, which **adds** to the **complexity** of a relatively easy task. Let's **separate** the problem into a few **sub-problems** and try to **solve** each of them one by one, which will lead us to the final result:

* Our **initial** sub-problem will be to **read the input data** entered by the user, and **store them in appropriate variables**.
* **Execution** of the main programming **logic**, which in our case is a batch of simple calculations of the properties that we already have.
* **Calculation** and shaping up the end **result**.

**The main** part of the programming logic **is** to **calculate** what will be the **distance passed after all changes** in speed. As during **execution** of the program, part of the **data** that we have **is modified**, we could **separate** the program **code** into a few **logically** separated **parts**:

* **Calculation** of the **distance** passed with initial speed.
* Change of **speed** and calculation of the **distance** passed.
* Last change of **speed** and **calculation**.
* **Summing up**.
