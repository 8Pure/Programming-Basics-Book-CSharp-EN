#### Separating the Constant Values in Variables

After carefully reading the requirements, we understand that once again we need to do **simple calculations**, however this time we will need **additional** logical **conditions**. We need to pay more **attention** to the moment of **making changes** in the final price, in order to be able to properly build the logic of our program. Again, the bold text gives us sufficient **guidelines** on how to proceed. For a start, we will separate the already **defined** values in **variables**, like we did in the previous tasks:

We will also do the same for the rest of the defined values:
