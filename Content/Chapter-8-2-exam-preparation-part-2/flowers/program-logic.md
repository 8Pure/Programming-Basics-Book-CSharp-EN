#### Preparing the Program Logic

Let's think of the most approprate way to **structure** or programming logic. By the requirements it becomes clear that the path of the program is divided mainly into two parts: **spring / summer** and **autumn / winter**. We can do the separation by conditional statement, by storing variables in advance for the **prices** of the individual flowers, as well as for the **end result**.

What remains is to perform **a few checks** regarding **the discounts** of the different types of flowers, depending on the season, and to modify the end result.
