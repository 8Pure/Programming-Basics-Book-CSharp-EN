#### Reading the Input Data and Creating Helper Variables

By the requirements we see that **first** we will read the **number** of students, and then, **their grades**. For that reason, **firstly** in a variable of **`int`** type we will read the **number** of students. In order to read and process the grades themselves, we will use a **`for`** loop. The value of the **`int`** variable will be the **end** value of the **`i`** variable from the loop. This way, **all** iterations of the loop will read **each one of the grades**.

Before executing the code of the **`for`** loop, we will create variables where we will store **the number of students** for each group: poor results (up to 2.99), results from 3 to 3.99, from 4 to 4.99 and grades above 5. We will also need one more variable, where we will store **the sum of all grades**, via which we will calculate the average grade of all students.
