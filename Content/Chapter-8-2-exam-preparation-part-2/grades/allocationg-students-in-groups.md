#### Allocating Students into Groups

We run the **loop** and inside it we **declare one more** variable, in which we will store the **currently** entered grade. The variable will be **`double`** type and upon each iteration we will check **what is its value**. According to this value, **we increase** the number of students in the relevant group by **1**, as we should not forget to also increase the **total** amount of the grades, which we also track.

We can calculate what **percentage** is taken by a particular **group of students** from the total number by **multiplying the number of students** in the relevant group by **100** and then dividing this by the **total number of students**. 

<table>
<tr>
<td width="10%"><img src="/assets/alert-icon.png" style="max-width:50px" /></td>
<td>Pay attention to the numeric data type that you work with upon doing these calculations.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

The **end result** is formed in the well know fashion - **up to the second symbol** after the decimal point.
