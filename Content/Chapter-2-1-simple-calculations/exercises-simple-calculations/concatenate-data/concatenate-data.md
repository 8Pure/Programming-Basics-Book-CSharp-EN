### Problem:	concatenation of text and numbers

Write a C# program, that reads a name, a last name, an age and a city from the console and prints a message of the following kind: **`You are <firstName> <lastName>, a <age>-years old person from <town>`**.

#### Hints and Guideliness

We add to the exististing Visual Studio solution one more console C# project with name “Concatenate-Data”.	We **write the code** which reads the input from the console:

![](/assets/chapter-2-images/04.Concatenate-data-01.png)

**The code** which prints the described in the condition of the problem message should be finished.

![](/assets/chapter-2-images/04.Concatenate-data-02.png)

In the picture above the code is blurred on purpose, in order for you to think of a way to finish it yourself.

Next, the solution should be tested locally with [**Ctrl+F5**] and by entering an exemplary input data.
