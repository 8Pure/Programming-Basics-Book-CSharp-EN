#### Switching Between Programs

Now **let's switch to the previous program** (square area). This happens with a double click on the file **``Program.cs``** from the previous project **“Square-Area”** in the panel [**Solution Explorer**] in Visual Studio:

![](/assets/chapter-2-images/02.Inches-to-centimeters-12.png)

We press again [**Ctrl+F5**]. This time the other project should start:

![](/assets/chapter-2-images/02.Inches-to-centimeters-11.png)

We switch back to the **“Inches-to-Centimeters”** project and start it with [**Ctrl+F5**]:

![](/assets/chapter-2-images/02.Inches-to-centimeters-09.png)

**Switching between projects** is very easy, isn't it? Just choose the file with the source code of the program, double click it and when it starts, the program from the current file is being executed.
