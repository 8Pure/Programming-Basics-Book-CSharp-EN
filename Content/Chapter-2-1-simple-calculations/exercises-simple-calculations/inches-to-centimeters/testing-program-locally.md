#### Testing the program locally 

Let us test with floating-point numbers, for example with **2.5**:

<table><tr><td><img src="/assets/alert-icon.png" style="max-width:50px" /></td>
<td>Depending on the regional settings of the operational system, it is possible instead of using a <b>decimal point </b> (US settings), to be used a <b>decimal comma</b> (BG settings).</td>
</tr></table>

If the program expects a decimal point and instead a number with a decimal comma is entered or the opposite (to enter a decimal point, when a decimal comma is expected), the following error will be received:

It is recomended to **change the settings of our computer** to use a **decimal point**:
