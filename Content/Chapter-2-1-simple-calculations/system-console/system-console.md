## System Console 

Simply called "**console**", the system, also the computer console, represents the tool by which we give the computer commands in a text format and receive the results from their execution again as a text. 

Generally the system console represents a text terminal, which means that it accpets and visualizes just **text** without any graphical elements like buttons, menus, etc. It usually looks like a black coloured window like this one:

In most operating systems, the **console** is available as a standalone application on which we write console commands. It is called a **Command Prompt** in Windows, and in Linux and Mac a **Terminal**. The console runs console applications. They read text from the command line and print text on the console. In this book we are going to learn programming mostly through creating **console applications**.
