## Numerical Expressions

In programming, we can calculate **numerical expressions**, for example:

```csharp
var expr = (3 + 5) * (4 â€“ 2);
```

The standart rule for priorities of the arithmetic operations is applied: **multiplying and dividing are always done before adding and substracting**. In case of an **expression in brackets, it is calculated first**, but we already know all of that from school math.
