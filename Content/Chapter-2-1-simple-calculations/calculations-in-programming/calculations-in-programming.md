## Calculations in Programming

We know that computers are machines that process data. All **data** is stored inside the computer memory (RAM) in **variables**. The variables are named areas in the memory, which keep a certain data type, for example a number or a text. Each of the **variables** in C# has a **name**, a **type** and a **value**. Here is how we would declare a variable and assign it with a value at the same time:

After being processed, data is again stored  in variables (in som–µ place in the memory saved for our program).
