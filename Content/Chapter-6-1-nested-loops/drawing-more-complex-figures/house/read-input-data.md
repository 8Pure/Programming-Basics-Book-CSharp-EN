<td><b>It is very important to check if the input data is correct!</b> In these problems it is not a problem to directly convert the data from the console into <b><code>int</code></b>, because it is said that we will receive valid integers. If you are making more complex programs it is a good practice to check the data. What will happen if istead of the character "–ê" the user inputs a number?</td>
