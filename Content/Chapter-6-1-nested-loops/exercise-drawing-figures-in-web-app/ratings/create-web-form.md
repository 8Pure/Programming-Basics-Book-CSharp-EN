#### Creating a Web Form

Open and redact the file **`Views/Home/Index.cshtml`**. Delete everything and insert the following code:

![](/assets/chapter-6-images/11.Ratings-04.png)

This code creates a web form **`<form>`** with a field **`"rating"`** for inputting a number in the interval [**0 â€¦ 100**] and a button [**Draw**] to send data from the form to the server. The action which will process the data is called **`/Home/DrawRatings`**, which means method **`DrawRatings`** in controller **`Home`**, which is in the file **`HomeController.cs`**. After the form the contents of **`ViewBag.Stars`** are printed. The code, which will be inside, will be dynamically generated by the HTML controller with a series of stars.
