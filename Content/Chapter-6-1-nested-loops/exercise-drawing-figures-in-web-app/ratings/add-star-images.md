#### Adding Star Images

Create a new **images** folder in the project, using [**Solution Explorer**]:
  
![](/assets/chapter-6-images/11.Ratings-07.png)

Now add **the pictures with the stars** (they are a part of the files with this project and can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/SoftUni/Programming-Basics-Book-CSharp-BG/tree/master/assets/chapter-6-assets)). Copy them from Windows Explorer and paste them in the **images** folder in [**Solution Explorer**] in Visual Studio.
