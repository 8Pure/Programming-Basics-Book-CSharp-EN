# Chapter 6.1. Nested Loops

In the current chapter we will be looking at **nested loops** and how to use **`for`** loops to **draw** various **figures on the console**, that contain symbols and signs, ordered in rows and columns on the console. We will use **single** and **nested loops** (loops that are in other loops), **calculations** and **checks**, in order to print on the console simple and not so simple figures by previously given sizes.
