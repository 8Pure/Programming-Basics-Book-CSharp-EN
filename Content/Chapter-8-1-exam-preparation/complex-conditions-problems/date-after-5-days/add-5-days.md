#### Add 5 Days

We are increasing **the day** with 5.

We check if **the day** has not exceeded the number of days it has in the **month**. If so, we must deduct the days of the month from the received day in order to receive our day on which day of the next month corresponds.

After we have passed in the **next month**, this should be noted by increasing the initial one by 1. We need to check if it has not been greater than 12 and if so, adjust. Because we can not skip more than **one month** when we increase by 5 days, the lower check is enough.
