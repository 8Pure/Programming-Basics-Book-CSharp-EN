### Problem: Sum of 3 Numbers

There are **3 integers** given. Write a program that checks if **the sum of two of the numbers is equal to the third**. For example, if the numbers are **3**, **5** and **2**, the sum of two of the numbers is equal to the third: **2 + 3 = 5**.

#### Input

The console reads **three integers**, one per line. The numbers are in range [**1 … 1000**].

#### Output

- Print a row containing the solution of the problem in the format "**a + b = c**", where **a**, **b** and **c** are among the three input numbers and **a ≤ b**.
- If the problem has no solution, print "**No**" on the console.
