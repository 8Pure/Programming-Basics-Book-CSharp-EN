We have to check if the **sum** of a pair of numbers is equal to the third. We have three possible cases:
* a + b = c
* a + c = b 
* b + c = a

We will write a **frame**, which will later be complemented by the required code. If none of the above three conditions is met, we will make our program to print "**No**".
