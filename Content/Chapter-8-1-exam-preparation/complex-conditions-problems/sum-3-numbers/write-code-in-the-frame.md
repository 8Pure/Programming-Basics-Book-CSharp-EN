#### Write Code in the Frame

We now have to understand the order in which the **two addends** will be written at the output of the program. For this purpose, we will do **a nested condition** that checks which of the two is the larger one. In the first case, it will be like this:

![](/assets/chapter-8-1-images/06.Sums-3-numbers-03.png)

Similarly, we will supplement the other two cases. The full code and output of the program will look like this:

![](/assets/chapter-8-1-images/06.Sums-3-numbers-04.png)
