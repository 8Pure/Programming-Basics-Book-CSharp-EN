#### Adding Stars in the Center of the Rectangle

Now, **in the body** of the loop let's add the **asterisks**. We'll check if we're on the **middle row**. If we are in the middle, we will draw **the row** together **with the asterisks**, if not - we will draw **a normal row**. The line with the asterisks has **`n - 2` empty spaces** (**`n`** is half the length and we remove the asterisk and the percentage), **two stars** and again **`n - 2` empty spaces**. We leave from the check the two percent at the beginning and at the end of the row.
