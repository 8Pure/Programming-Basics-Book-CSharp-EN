#### Tips and Tricks, and Reading the Input Data

In the task of drawing figures the most important thing to consider is **the sequence** in which we will draw. Which items are **repeated** and with what **steps**. We can clearly see that **the top and bottom** parts of the diamond are **same**. The easiest way to solve the problem is by doing **a loop** that draws the **upper part**, and then another **one loop** that draws the **bottom part** (opposite to the top).

We will read the number **n** from the console.
