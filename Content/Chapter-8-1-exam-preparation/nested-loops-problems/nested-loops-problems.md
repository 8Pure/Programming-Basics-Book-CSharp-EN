# Nested Loops â€“ Problems

**The last** \(sixth\) problem of the "Programming Basics" Practical Exam requires using of **several nested loops and more complex logic inside them**. The task examines students' ability to think in a algorithmic way and to solve non-trivial problems that require loops. Let's see a few examples of exam problems.

Let's solve a few a **sample problems** with nested loops and more-complex logic:

* [Problem: Increasing 4 Numbers](/Content/Chapter-8-1-exam-preparation/nested-loops-problems/nested-loops-problems/problem-increasing-4-numbers.md)
* [Problem: Generating Rectangles](/Content/Chapter-8-1-exam-preparation/nested-loops-problems/nested-loops-problems/problem-generating-rectangles.md)
