#### Reading the Input Data and Sample Idea for the Solution

Read the input data from the console. We will also create a **counter**, which will keep the number of rectangles found.

It is very important to be able to imagine the problem before we begin to solve it. In our case it is required to search for rectangles in a coordinate system. The thing we know is that the **left point** will always have the coordinate **`x`, smaller** than **the right**. Accordingly, **the upper one** will always have a smaller **`Ñƒ`** coordinate than **the lower one**. To find all the rectangles, we'll have to make **a loop** similar to the previous problem, but this time, **not every next loop** will start from **the next number** because some of **the coordinates** can be equal (for example **`left`** and **`top`**).

With the variables **`left`** and **`right`** we will follow the coordinates **horizontally** and with **`top`** and **`bottom`** - **vertically**.
