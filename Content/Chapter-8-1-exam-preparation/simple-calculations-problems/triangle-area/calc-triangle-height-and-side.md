#### Calculate triangle side and height

We have to calculate **the side** and **the height** of the triangle. From the pictures, as well as the condition **`y2 = y3`**, we notice that the one **side** is always parallel to the horizontal axis. This means that its **length** is equal to the length of the segment between its coordinates **`x2` and `x3`**, which is equal to the difference between the larger and the smaller coordinates. Similarly, we can calculate **the height**. It will always be equal to the difference between **`y1` and `y2`** (or **`y3`**, as they are equal). Since we do not know if **`x2`** is greater than **`x3`**, or **`y1`** will be below or above the triangle side, we will use **the absolute values** of the difference to always get positive numbers, because one segment can not have a negative length.
