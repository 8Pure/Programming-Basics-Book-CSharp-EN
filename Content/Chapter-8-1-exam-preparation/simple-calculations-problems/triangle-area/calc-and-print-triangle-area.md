#### Calculate and print triangle area

By our familiar formula of finding an **area of a triangle** we will calculate it. An important thing to keep in mind is that although we get only integers at the input, **the area** will not always be an integer. That's why we use a variable of type **`double`** for the area. We have to convert the right side of the equation, because if we give whole numbers as equation parameters, our result will also be an integer.

The only thing left is to print the area on the console.
