### Problem: Increasing Elements 

A number of **n** numbers are given: **a1**, **a2**, **…**, **an**. Calculate **the length of the longest increasing sequence** of consecutive elements in the row of numbers.

#### Input

The input data is read from the console. The first row is an integer **n** (**0 ≤ n ≤ 1000**). On the following **n** lines are **n** integers in the range [**-1000 … 1000**]: **a1**, **a2**, **…**, **an**.

#### Output

On the console must be printed one number - **the length** of the longest increasing sequence.
