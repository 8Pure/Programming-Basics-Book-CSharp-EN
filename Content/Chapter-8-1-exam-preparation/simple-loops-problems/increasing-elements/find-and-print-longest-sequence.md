#### Find and Print the Longest Sequence

It remains to be seen which of all sequences is **the longest**. We will do this by checking in the loop if **the sequence** we are **currently** has become longer than the **longest by now**. The whole loop will look like this:

![](/assets/chapter-8-1-images/08.Increasing-numbers-03.png)

Finally, we print the length of **the longest** sequence found.
