#### Allocating Numbers and Print Results

To find out in which of **the three sums** we need to add the number, we will divide its **sequence number into three** and we will use the remainder. We will use the variable **`i`**, which tracks **the number of spins** per loop, to find out which sequence number we are. When the remainder of **`i/3`** is **zero**, it means we will add this number to **the first** sum when it is **1** to the **second** and when it is **2** to **the third**.

Finally, we will print the result on the console in the required **format**.
