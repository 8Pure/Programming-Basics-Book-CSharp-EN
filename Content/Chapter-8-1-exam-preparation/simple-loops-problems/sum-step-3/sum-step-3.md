### Problem: Sum Step 3

There are **n** integers **a1, a2, …, an** given. Calculate the sums:
-	**sum1 = a1 + a4 + a7** + … (the numbers are summed, starting from the first one with step 3).
-	**sum2 = a2 + a5 + a8** + … (the numbers are summed, starting from the second one with step 3).
-	**sum3 = a3 + a6 + a9** + … (the numbers are summed, starting from the third one with step 3).

#### Input

The input data is read from the console. The first row is an integer **n (0 ≤ n ≤ 1000)**. On the next **n** rows are **n** integers in the range [**-1000 … 1000**]: **a1, a2, …, an**.

#### Output

On the console should be printed 3 rows containing the 3 sums in a format such as in the example.
