## Online Evaluation System (Judge)

**All exams and homeworks** are automatically **tested** through the online Judge system: [https://judge.softuni.bg](https://judge.softuni.bg). **For each** of the problems there are **visible** (zero) tests to help you understand what is expected of the problem and fix your mistakes, as well as **racing** tests that are **hidden** and check if your solution is working properly. In **Judge** system you can log in with your **softuni.bg account**.

**How** does the testing in **Judge** work? **You upload** the source code and from the menu below you choose to compile as **C#** program. The program is being **tested** with a series of tests, giving **points** for each **successful** test.
