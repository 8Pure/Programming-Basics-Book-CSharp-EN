#### Determining Point Location

We read the input data from the console:

![](/assets/chapter-8-1-images/04.Point-in-figure-04.png)

We will initialize two variables that will mark whether **the point** is in one of the rectangles.

![](/assets/chapter-8-1-images/04.Point-in-figure-05.png)

When printing the message, we will check whether any of the variables has accepted a value of **`true`**. It is enough **only one** of them to be **`true`** to find the point in the figure.
