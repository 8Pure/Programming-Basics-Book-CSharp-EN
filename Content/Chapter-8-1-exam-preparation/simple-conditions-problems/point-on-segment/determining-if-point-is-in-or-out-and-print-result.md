#### Determining if Point is In or Out the Segment and Print Result

It remains to be found whether **the point** is on or out of the line. The point will be **on the line** whenever it **matches** one of the other two points or its x coordinate lies **between them**. Otherwise, the point is **outside the line**. After checking, we get one of the two messages, which one is satisfied.
