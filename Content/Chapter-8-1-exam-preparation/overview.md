## "Programming Basics" Practical Exam

The course **"Programming Basics"** ends with a **practical exam**. There are **6** problems included, and you will have **4 hours** to solve them. **Each** of the exam problems will **cover** one of the **topics** studied during the course. Problem topics are as follows:

- Problem with simple calculations (no conditions)
- Problem with simple condition
- Problem with more complex conditions
- Problem with loop
- Problem with nested loops (drawing a figure on the console)
- Problem with nested loops and more complex logic

## Online Evaluation System (Judge)

**All exams and homework assignments** are automatically **tested** through the online Judge system: [https://judge.softuni.bg](https://judge.softuni.bg). **For each** of the problems there are **visible** (zero point) tests to help you understand what is expected of the problem and fix your mistakes, as well as **competition** tests that are **hidden** and check if your solution is working properly. In the **Judge** system you can log in with your **softuni.bg account**.

**How** does the testing in **Judge** work? **You upload** the source code and from the menu below you choose to compile as a **C#** program. The program is being **tested** with a series of tests, giving **points** for each **successful** test.
